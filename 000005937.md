  " O, noble Kent, this praise doth thee belong,

Most hard to be controlled, impatientest of wrong,

Who, when the Norman first with pride and horror swayed,

Threw'st off the servile yoke upon the English laid,  
  
  
  And with a high resolve most bravely did restore
That liberty so long enjo3'ed by thee before;
Not suffering foreign laws should thy free custom bind,
Then only shewd'st thyself of ancient Saxon kind.
Of all the shires be thou sir-named the free,  
  
  
  And foremost ever placed when they shall reckoned be."

  PREFACE.


Two chief reasons for this simple " History of Kent
for the Young "—that is, not for children, but for lasses and
lads who already know at any rate the outline and the
main features of the History of England :  
  
  
  First.—A hearty belief in the wholesomeness of
broad
minded local patriotism.  
  
  
  Second.—A sorrowful conviction that the majority of

English men and women know very much less about

their own country in general, and their own

neighbourhood in particular, than they do about

distant and foreign lands.


The chief difficulties which have faced me in this
compilation, for it is but a compilation, have been to select
judiciously from a huge mass of material, and to present
the selections in a simple and interesting form.


I cannot even claim originality of idea for this little
book, for I was first inspired to undertake its composition
<!-- Leaf 12, Page: VIII -->
by " A History of Cornwall for my Children," written by
a great friend, which seemed to me to fill up so nicely a
long standing gap in our system of home educ(ation that I
resolved to 'pay it the sincerest tribute in my power—to
imitate it.


In addition to the usual authorities I am indebted for
much information about the Weald to Mr. Robert Furley's
work on that district of our county; and in order to be
as accurate as possible I have visited personally almost
every place, great and small, associated with our county
history.

  HISTORY OF KENT.  
  
  
  CHAPTER I.  
  
  
  EARLY KENT.


The meanings of the names of places is so interesting
and valuable a study that I think, before you start upon
the history of this grand old county of ours, you should
know that the word " Kent " means " corner," coming from
the German " Kainte," and still existing in the word
\"canton," such as the canton of our n.itional white ensign,
—the Union Jack in the corner, and the " cantons " or
divisions of Switzerland. I like this derivation better than
from the Celtic " caint," meaning " open country," if only
for the reason that ancient Kent had very little open
country at all.


It is always a bold and difficult matter to speak about
events which happened in the long-ago ages in countries
about which no regular histories were written, and so I
don't ask you to believe as undeniable what I am going to
say about the first mention of the county of Kent in
ancient times. I only tell you what is the belief of more
learned men than myself who have tried to make a study
of the subject.

  HISTORY OF KENT.


So it is said that about four hundred years before
Christ, Pythias, a mathematician belonging to Marseilles,
then the Greek colony of Massalia, landed in Kent; and
more, to show you how absurd it often is for people
to talk about old things as if they were always better than
what we are accustomed to, just because they are old
things, he is said to have observed that even then—more
than two thousand years ago—the grain gathered from the
great wheat fields of Kent was thrashed under cover
because there was so little fine weather.. So the next
time you hear people whimpering for "good old-fashioned
weather " tell them about Pythias.


Our country was at that time only known to the
civilized world as the land where tin was to be found, and
the Phœnicians, one of the most interesting of ancient
people, had a regular trade with Cornwall, and brought the
tin for shipment to a place called Mictis, or Ictis, which
may have been the Isle of Thanet, although some people
think it to have been the Isle of Wight, or St. Michael's
Mount, off Cornwall.


To show how little was known of Brit.ain, even by later
writers such as Str.ibo, Diodorus Siculus, and Ptolemy, it
was believed to be the end of a vast continent stretching
away northward into the shades of eternal night, until the
Roman Agricola, in A.D. 80 or thereabouts, sailed round
it and proved it to be an island.


Another old story says that Kent got its name from
Canutus, a follower of Brutus, the Trojan, who sailed
here from Greece, settled, and founded a line of Kings.
This, I tell you candidly, you need not believe.


The first real knowledge we get of Kent is from that
wonderful book, the Commentaries of Julius Cæsar.


In the year 55 B.C. he came over to see what sort of
a country Britain was. The Romans, like we English,
were always looking out for new countries to conquer and
settle, and no doubt Cæsar, having heard of the tin trade,
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 3 -->
thought that there might possibly be something else worth
having in the country. At any rate, he came over and
found our land inhabited by people of the Belgic tribe of
Gauls, barbarians of course, but I don't think quite such
barbarians as we are taught to believe, for they had a
distinct religion of their own, with gods—Taramis, the god
of thunder, answering to the Roman Jupiter; Teutates,
the god of journeys; Hesus, or Camulus, the god of war;
Beleus, or Belinus, the chief of all, god of the sun and of fire;
Cama, or Diana, and so on. Moreover, they could work
skilfully in bronze, and went to war in chariots—a very
sure proof that they had made some progress in
manufacture.


I am not going to bother you about the Druids, for the
learned men of to-day are beginning to doubt if Cæsar
found any Druidism in England at all, although it possibly
lingered in Wales, whither he did not penetrate.


Now, before we go any further, I want you to
knowsomething about the appearance of the Kent to which
Julius Cæsar came, for, of course, it was entirely different
from what it is now.


Scientific men tell us that not a very long time ago,
compared with the age of our earth, England and Europe
were joined together by land. In Cæsar's time the English
Channel at its narrowest point was much shallower than it
is now, and even in the sixteenth century the Kentish coast
people used to speak of a ridge of land between Folkestone
and Boulogne, called the " Ripraffs," which at a low spring
tide was only covered by fourteen feet of water; and of
another between Dover and Calais, wdiich was called the
\"Vane"—now marked as the Varne shoal. The Island of
Thanet, best known to you perhaps as having Ramsgate,
Margate, and Broadstairs upon it, was really an island
when Cæsar came, and the present narrow stream of the
Wantsum was half-a-mile broad. Richborough, which is
now a long way from the sea, was a place of arrival and  
  
  
  b 2
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 4 -->
departure for ships until the beginning of the seventh
century, and even in the time of Henry the Eighth, about
1515, there were men living who had seen laden barges pass
f rom Richborough to Reculver. At any rate, the Channel
was important enough as a water way to make the Romans
secure it by building a great fortress at each end of it—at
Reculver on the north, and at Richborough, where the two
sand spits of Ebbsfleet and Sandwich almost met together
and made a narrow entrance. Minster was a port of the
Isle of Thanet, and had a bay before it. At Sarre, where
the river Stour fell into the Wantsum channel, was a ferry;
and the river Stour was navigable for ships as far as
Fordwich, which remained the port of Canterbury until the
time of Queen Elizabeth.


The great Marshes of Romney, Denge, Guildsord, and
Walling, which we may call Romney Marsh, were a tidal
morass; that is to say, a vast mud flat alternately covered
and uncovered as the tide rose and fell, and no doubt at
not a very remote time before Cæsar came was a regular
bay of the sea.


Mr. Furley in his book upon the Weald of Kent, to wliich
I owe a good deal of what I shall tell you, stays :—


\"All Romney Marsh proper (the part between Hythe,
Romney, and Appledore) was re-claimed (changed from a
mud flat into pasture) by the erection of the Rhee Wall
from Appledore to Romney, but by whom the Wall was
erected is uncertain The Marsh was certainly under
cultivation in the time of the Romans, as Roman remains
are found extensively over the whole area."


So this Rhee Wall, which is now marked by the line of
the road from Appledore to New Romney and is still called
the same, was the boundary line between the meadow land
and the marsh land, of which the northern limit is marked
by Appledore and the western by Rye. South of the
Marsh was a great bank of shingle extending from where
Rye now is to where the mouth of the Rother then was, and
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 5 -->
much of this still remains, although, of course, the Marsh
has long been drained and made exactly' like the land on
the other side of the Rhee Wall. I have tried to show this
on my map, so look at it.,  
  
  
  4


The river Rother, which now runs out to sea at Rye,
and for some distance forms the boundary of our county,
ran, until a great storm in the reign of Edward the First,
by Appledore and out to sea at New Romney, forming a
bay called Romney Hoy. Hythe was a sea port almost to
the time of Queen Elizabeth.


When Cæsar came, and during the Roman occupation
perhaps, the Rother flowed from Appledore round the edge
of the Marsh to Hythe. At any rate, there was water
communication between Hythe and Appledore along the
course of the present Military Canal, for you may still see
the remains stretching down the hill side from Lympne of
the Roman Castle of Portus Lemannis, now called
Studfall Castle, and we read that in 893 the Danes sailed
from Lympne to Appledore, which they burned.


You perhaps know how far from the sea New Romney
now is. Well, although I don't think that Old Romney
was ever an important place, in about 1070 New Romney
became a port, which was famous for two hundred years
later. We read of ships being captured in its harbour, and
in 1168 Thomas a Becket attempted to escape to France
from New Romney, which belonged to his Archbishopric,
but was driven back by a storm.


This has nothing to do with the Romans, but I want
you to get a clear idea of the very different appearance of
our county in their time.


The whole of the west part of Kent from the edge of
Romney Marsh to Sevenoaks was thick forest, part of the
great Andreds Waid, or Forest of Anderida. This was
called the Weald of Kent, and although the forest has
disappeared you may still trace its exact extent by the
names of places ending in "den"—a wooded hollow or
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 6 -->
valley; "hurst," meaning thicker forest; "ley"—open
glade; " chart "—forest. All the rest of Kent up to the
line of the old Dover Road, the Roman Watling Street,
was thickly wooded, without being actually forest, except
along the courses of rivers like the Medway, the Stour, the
Darent, and the Cray, which were pleasant, fertile valleys.


The whole of the country north of Watling Street
between Canterbury and Dartford was, except where
between Canterbury and Faversham the road cut through
the Blean Forest, marsh land.


To make it clearer for you I have drawn a map which
I hope gives fairly the appearance of the county under the
Romans. You will notice the names of still existing towns
and villages in.slanting letters; but, of course, many of them
were not built until long after.
<!-- Leaf 23 -->
  
  CHAPTER II.  
  
  
  THE ROMAN INVASION.


Now, I do hope that the words " Roman Invasion " won't
dishearten you and make you feel beforehand that you are
going to be told a lot of dry, prosy, uninteresting stuff
about a time so long ago that you cannot imagine anything
interesting in connection with it. Believe me, if you are
patient, and if you think as you read, you will be astonished
how very much more interesting the Roman invasion of
our county will soon appear than much of the gossip about
something which happened yesterday in your own
neighbourhood.


When you go, let us say, to Richborough or to Studfall
Castle at Lympne, or to the great silent camp at Keston
(about which I will tell you a funny story by-and-bye), or
when you look along the Stone Street running straight as
an arrow flight over hill and dale, and you think of the
wonderful people who built them, and of the splendid
efforts of the old men of Kent to prevent them from
building them, and reflect that they are still after all these
hundreds of years strong and massive, they will appear to
you something more than mere masses of stones and bricks,
or mounds of earth, or a long, hard, dusty road.


However, I promise not to keep you very long in Roman
Kent, absorbingly interesting as it is to me, or we shall
have no time for the still more interesting and valuable
history of later times.
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 8 -->

I said that no doubt Julius Cæsar had an idea that the
land of tin was also the land of something else worth
getting hold of, especially when we read that the Britons
were warned of Cæsar's intentions by merchants from Gaul,
which seems to show that already there was commerce
between our island and the continent. The Britons sent
an embassy over to Cæsar. The ambassadors were received
civilly by the great Roman, and they were accompanied
home by an officer named Comius, who had instructions to
keep his eyes open, and to induce the Britons to become
the allies, the friends of Rome, which would have been a
very convenient arrangement for Cæsar, inasmuch as under
pretence of friendship he could carry out his plans of
making Britain a Roman colony without the bother and
expense of fighting.


But the Britons did not enter into the arrangement at
all, for no doubt the Gaulish merchants had told them what
they might expect if they made the acquaintance with a
man who was master by force of arms of half the known
world.


Cæsar left Portus Itius—probably the watering place
Wissant, near Boulogne—and in nine hours was at Dover
or Deal, the standard bearer of the Tenth Legion being the
first man to land. This landing was done in the face of
the Britons, who were assembled on the shore, but who
very soon attacked the Romans. There was some hard
fighting in which the chariots, to the wheels of which were
affixed blades, did good work, and later on the Seventh
Legion, acting as an outpost, was surprised and almost cut
to pieces.


From all of which Cæsar decided that if Britain was to
be a Roman colony it would have to be fought for. He
only remained twenty-five days, and, having found out what
he wanted—the temper of the Britons and a good place for
landing, returned on September 20th to Gaul.  
  
  
  Next year, B.C. 54, Cæsar planned a serious expedition,
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 9 -->
and had boats specially built for the landing of troops.

He landed, probably at Deal, and marched straight

inland, apparently unopposed, until he found the Britons
entrenched—that is to say, assembled behind earth works
and ditches at Bursted, which I think must be the Bursted
near Upper Hardres, as it is on a straight line for London,
known even then as " the city of ships?," and no doubt much
associated with the trade of the country.


The Seventh Legion—the same which had been so
unkindly treated by the Britons before—cleared the natives
out very soon, but this important post was hardly won
when the news Ccime that a great storm had almost
wrecked the fleet lying off Deal. So the Romans were
obliged to stay until their ships could be repaired, and
Cæsar built a great camp somewhere about Deal and
Walmer, and prepared himself for anything which might
happen.


Meanwhile the Britons assembled again under a Prince
Cassivelaunus and attacked the Romans. The Romans
won the victory, but paid dearly in human life for it, and
marched on to London, crossing the Thames at Cowey
Stakes, near Walton.


Cassivelaunus saw that his half-disciplined,
rudelyarmed men were no match for the terrible method of war
which the Romans had learned by the experience of
centuries, and so he determined to worry and harass them
with that irregular sort of warfare carried on everywhere
but in the open country, which was afterwards used so
effectively by the Spaniards against the French in the
Peninsula, and by the French against the Germans during
the last great war. At the same time four kings of Kent,
named Cingetorix, Carnilius, Taximagulus, and Segonax,
attacked the Roman camp at Deal, but they were beaten.
So Cassivelaunus offers to surrender. Cæsar accepts his
submission, very gladly no doubt, orders him to pay an
annual fine, and sails for Gaul—gladly enough also.
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 10 -->

After this the Romans left us alone for nearly a hundred
years. In A.D. 43, when Claudius was emperor, the
Romans landed under Aulus Plautius, but the Britons
seemed to have profited in the meantime by the lesson
taught them by Julius Cæsar, for they beat the Romans
everywhere, and Aulus Plautius was obliged to shut
himself up in a great camp, which some learned gentlemen say
was that camp in the park at Holwood, near Keston, and
from here he sent urgent messages to Claudius for help.


I happened to be at Keston a year or two back, and after
wandering about the War Bank and examining the few
Roman remains there I went into a farmhouse at the foot
of the hill. I asked a man there what he thought the
stones on the War Bank were. " Why, sir," he said, " they
say a gentleman named Cæsar used to live there with his
family."  
  
  
  " That was a very long time ago," I said.


"Yes," he said, "it were. I've lived in these parts a
matter of forty years and I never knowed anybody as
knowed him, so I lay it were more'n a hundred years ago ! "


I didn't tell him it was nearer two thousand than a
hundred, for he might have thought I was trying to make
fun of him.


Well, Claudius came in obedience to the call, and we are
told that he brought elephants with him, but you may just
as well believe that he brought Krupp guns with him, for
the biggest ships of those days were not so big as many a
modern yacht.* However, elephants or no elephants, he
beat our men of Kent, and after them the rest of England
so quickly and easily that within a very short time Britain
was added to the list of Roman colonies. Julius Agricola
followed him, and under his prudent government Britain


* In 1080 the tumulus on Parliament Hill, Highgate, was opened, and
in it was found the skeleton of a mammoth, with the head of a spear.
This was stud to be an elephant—hence the idea that the Romans
brought elephantB.
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 11 -->
became quiet and prosperous; her commerce was developed,
and she got to be quite reconciled to foreign rule. He it
was who first proved Britain to be an island by sailing
round it.


Kent was not behindhand in the general development of
manufactures and trade. In the Marshes, on the edge of
the river Swale, which divides the island of Sheppey from
the mainland, are still to be seen remains of the old
Roman pottery works, whence came that blue-black
LTpchurch ware, as it is called, which must have been
highly thought of, as specimens of it have been found
amongst Roman ruins all over England, <and even in France,
{empty}.although it is not so fine as the ware made at Castor in
Northamptonshire.


Chalk was dug at Dartford, Crayford, and Chislehurst,
and exported to the continent, and in the country of
Zealand have been found altars dedicated to the goddess of
the Kentish chalk workers. We know that the Romans
carried on a large manufacture of iron in the great forests
of the neighbouring county of Sussex, and traces of the
same industry have been found in the Weald of Kent,
although not to so great an extent—notably at Frittenden.
Corn was sent in large quantities to Gaul, whilst the
oysters of the Kentish coast were famous even in Imperial
Rome.


The Roman remains in Kent, if not amongst the finest
in England, are interesting as being the earliest. Ruins of
the great Roman castles at Portus Lemannis—Lympne,
and at Rutupiœ—Richborough, are tolerably extensive. Of
the third great castle, at Regulbium—Reculver, only a
couple of walls remain, but two pillars which formerly
decorated one of its public buildings may be seen standing
in the pleasant garden behind the baptistery at Canterbury
Cathedral. At Dover Castle you may see the remains of
the only Roman lighthouse in Britain. Bits of Roman
work appear in the walls and in all the old churches of
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 12 -->
Canterbury and Rochester, but there is nothing of such
surpassing interest as the Roman villa at Bignor in Sussex,
or the relics of such towns as Silchester, Wroxeter, and the
places along the Roman wall in Northumberland and
Cumberland.


You see, as Kent was to the Romans what it has been to
all other foreigners and will be to the end of time, the
stepping stone, the doorway into England, it was very
necessary that this entrance should be made sure. The
Romans had to fight for every acre of ground, and in order
to keep what they won they had to build castles and make
camps. Hence Kent is full of Roman camps, which
communicated with each other by magnificent roads, many
of which are in use to this day. I don't say that the
Romans made every camp which is called Roman. The
Britons whom they conquered were quite clever enough to
see the advantage of strengthening high hills, and most of
the Roman camps in Britain were British before. The
Roman camp was usually square, and the British camp
round; but on high hills with steep sides the Romans
simply cut two or three trenches, one higher than the other,
round the top of the hill; and in most cases, except where
the camps are on low ground and therefore liable to be
ploughed over and otherwise destroyed, the trenches
remain in wonderful preservation, so that at a long distance
you can tell a hill which has a camp on it.


The Roman roads, unlike the British track-ways, almost
always ran straight ahead. If a mountain came in the way
the Roman engineer, instead of going round it as a Briton
would have done, went ewer it; and if you consider that the
Romans drove their splendid roads in Britain through a
country which was for the most part wild, pathless forest
or marsh and bog, and that nothing turned them aside, you
will realise what a wonderful people they were in their
determination to conquer every obstacle, human or other.  
  
  
  Take a map—look at my little map, and see how straight
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 13 -->
our Kentish Roman roads run—at any rate, the three
principal ones—that from Dover to London, the Watling
Street; that from Lympne to Canterbury, the Stone
Street; and that from Dover to Richborough. And we
still use them !


I have nothing more to tell you about Kent under the
Romans, except to mention the introduction of Christianity,
because, after the first struggle of defence, the Kentish
Britons became, like all other Britons, merged—that is,
mixed—with the great mass of the conquered people, and,
therefore, ceased to have a separate history.


Christianity, which came through Gaul, not through the
Roman, was introduced, it is said, about A.D. 161 by a
King Lucius. The first British Martyr was St. Alban
under the reign of Diocletian. In 314 three British
bishops went to the Council of Aries, but after the
departure of the Romans the country sank into an
indescribably miserable condition, Christianity seems to
have entirely died out, and the only benefits which the
inhabitants seem to have derived from the four hundred
years' rule of Rome were the great roads and the draining
of Romney Marsh, for they even feared to live in the
towns built by the Romans, believing that they were
haunted by evil spirits, and places like Canterbury and
Rochester remained for many years empty and silent.
<!-- Leaf 30 -->
  
  CHAPTER III.  
  
  
  THE KINGDOM OF KENT.


You will read in Appendix A what I have to say about
Kent as a county so specially connected with our kings and
queens that of all counties in England I consider it to
deserve best the name of the Royal County. This name is
now given to Berkshire simply because Windsor Castle
happens to be in Berkshire, but, apart from the reasons
given in the Appendix, Kent was a Royal County once
in the truest sense of the name, in*ismuch as it was a
Kingdom.


I mentioned in the last chapter four " kings " of Kent
who fought against the Romans, but, although we call
them " kings," they were really only chieftains of districts or
assemblies of families. In fact, they were like the chiefs
of Scottish clans in after times, kings only in that they
were independent and owed obedience to nobody.


But now the real history of Kent begins, and it is the
more interesting because we are on tolerably firm ground,
and can say, at any rate with fair certainty, and not
hesitatingly as before, that this thing happened <and that
that person did such and such things. Even about the
Roman period there is a great deal which can only be
guessed at, a great deal which we can only speak about as
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 15 -->
probable, and a great deal more about which we know
nothing at all, so that whenever a Roman altar or a Roman
inscription—writing, that is,—is dug up it is eagerly
examined and read in the hope that it may teach us
something new.


Well, the last Romansoldier left Britain in A.D. 413,
and for some reasons it was a bad thing for the country.
The Britons must have become much civilised, and were as
happy and prosperous as people ever can be under foreign
rulers. The strong arm of the Roman soldier kept them
safe, and under Roman law people were able to go about
their business with a freedom which they did not enjoy
again for many centuries.


At the same time they lost their old manliness and
bravery, for, although Britons served as soldiers in the
Roman legions, it was the care of the Romans to keep the
Britons down as much as possible, and not to give them
a chance of freeing themselves by force of arms.


Consequently, directly the Romans left, the Britons were
so weak and defenceless that they could do nothing to
prevent the savage tribes of the Picts and Scots, who lived
beyond the great wall of which I spoke before, and who
had never been really conquered, from bursting over the
country, consuming, destroying, and killing wherever they
went, and the Britons heartily wished that the Romans
were back again.


So they appealed to Aetius, a good and great Roman,
who was then engaged in trying to keep the once mighty
Roman Empire up ag.ainst the barbarians, who were
attacking it on every side, in a s<ad address called " The
groans of the Britons;" but Aetius had quite enough to do
at home, and he declined to give any assistance.


This was in the year 443, and Vortigern was King of
Kent.


Then happened a great event. Three tribes of the people,
called Cimbrians, occupied the north-west coast of what is
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 16 -->
now Germany, from the mouths of the Rhine to the
Peninsula of Denmark. These were the Angles, the Saxons,
and the Jutes.


The >Saxons lived on the narrow neck of the Denmark
Peninsula, and about the mouth of the Elbe, and with them
was the tribe of Frisians. Their land is now Sehleswig
Holstein. The Angles lived North of the Saxons; and
beyond them, in what is now Jutland, were the Jutes.


The Britons, in despair at the refusal of Aetius to help
them against the Picts and Scots, invited the Jutes to
come over, promising them land and payment. And so in
the year 445 Hengist and Horsa came over " in three
long ships " and landed at Ebbsfleet, " the harbour of
Epwine," in Pegwell Bay, half way between Ramsgate and
iS^indwich.


They at once set to work and beat the Picts and Scots
well at the battle of Stamford. But all this time Hengist
was noting everything, and when he saw what a rich and
pleasant country it was, and what poor creatures the
Britons had become under Roman rule, the idea of settling
for good seemed very pleasant, and not very difficult to
carry out.


So he artfully persuaded the British prince Vortigern
that more soldiers would be needed to keep the Picts and
Scots back, and in 449 seventeen large ships with more
Jutes arrived. Then, to keep up the appearance of
friendship, he allowed his grand-daughter Rowena to
marry Vortigern, and her father Œsc was made the first
Earl of Kent.


Hengist kept up his deceitful game, and when in 452
more Jutish ships with soldiers arrived he thought it was
time to throw off his mask and to begin his real work of
conquering Kent for himself, making as his excuse for
declaring war the delay of the Britons in paying the
increased number of their allies. He inarched alon«*
the Watling Street to Canterbury, which he destroyed,
<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 17 -->
and proceeded towards London. But instead of
keeping directly on his course he turned suddenly
southward. Perhaps he was afraid of Rochester,
which still had its sturdy Roman walls and was
garrisoned by the Britons, or perhaps he was tempted to
leave his course by the rich country of the Medway valley.
Near Aylesford, in 455, he met the Britons under Vortigern,
and there was a great battle in which the Britons were
utterly beaten. Horsa,' the brother of Hengist, met
Catigern, the brother of Vortimer, son of Vortigern, in
single combat, and both were killed. That strange old
stone monument, called Kits Coty House, which stands in
a field just below the main road from Rochester to
Maidstone, near the Lower Bell Inn, is said to mark the
grave of Catigern, whilst the village of Horsted, on the
road to Chatham, is to be associated with the burial of
Horsa.


After this victory Hengist declared himself King of
Kent. He followed up the Britons and beat them again at
Crayford, but is supposed to have been badly beaten by
them in a battle fought somewhere between Hythe and
Folkestone. Perhaps you have seen the collection of
human skulls and bones at Hythe Church. Well, by some
people they are said to be the skulls and bones of the
Britons who were killed in this great battle, whilst another
collection which used to be at Folkestone is supposed to be
the remains of the Jutes who fell in the same fight. I am
not of this opinion, but I like you to hear all our Kentish
traditions about interesting things.


There is no history of this great battle, but from the
fact that Hengist and his Jutes remained quietly shut up
for some years after in the Isle of Thanet it would seem
that they had met with some great check in the progress of
their conquest; and if local tradition may sometimes be
trusted as a help to history, I am inclined to think that
the battle took place, not between Hythe and Folkestone,  
  
  
  c
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 18 -->
but at Stonar, near Sandwich. At any rate, after this
quiet period the Jutes broke out of Thanet, beat the
Britons at Ebbsfleet, took the Roman fortresses at
Richborough and Reculver, and Hengist's authority was
firmly secured.


In the year 477 the Saxons, who had long been
plundering the east coasts of England, having no doubt
heard of Hengist's success, resolved to see if they could not
get a slice of the land and its wealth, which was to be had
for a little fighting, and under a leader named Cymen
landed at Selsea Bill, in Sussex, at a place now called
Keynor—Cymen's Ora or Shore. Old names die a hard
death, for not only did Cymen give his name to Keynor,
but his sons Wlencing and Cissa gave their names to
Lancing and Cissbury, and perhaps Chichester, in Sussex.


Still the Jutes remained in Kent, for the nature of the
surrounding country made it difficult for them to extend
their possessions—the great forest of the Andredswald
shutting them in on the west, <and the Marshes on the
north.


In 564 Ethelbert—a famous name in our Kentish
history—became King, and the country prospered.
Canterbury, which had never been re-built since Hengist
destroyed it a hundred years before, was settled iigain, and
the old trade with the continent resumed. But the young
King Ethelbert began to get anxious about the progress
which his neighbours, the S<axons, were making. They
had taken the old Roman fortress at Anderida, now
Pevensey, and had marched, no doubt along the Roman
road, by wtay of Lewes, the Brighton Downs, and Bramber,
to Chichester, and thence along the magnificent Stone
Street into Surrey, of course on their way to London. In
568 Ethelbert assembled his Kentish men and marched
in a north-westerly direction to find the Saxons. He came
up to them on Wimbledon Common, no doubt entrenched
in what is still called Cæsar's Camp, and a battle took place
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 19 -->
—the first historical battle between Englishmen and
Englishmen, for although Angles, Saxons, and Jutes were
different tribes they were of the same race. Ethelbert
was beaten, and had to return to Kent, leiiving the county
of Surrey in the hands of the Saxons.


In 597 an important event happened. This was the
landing of Saint Augustine at Ebbsfleet—the same spot at
which Hengist had arrived. I told you that under the
Roman rule the Britons had become Christians, and that
after the Romans had gone they went back to heathenism.
Of course the Saxons, Angles, and Jutes had never been
Christians.


Then Ethelbert married Bertha, daughter of Charibert,
King of Paris, who was a Christian. He brought her to
the palace of the Kentish kings near Canterbury—close to
where the beautiful gateway of St. Augustine's Priory now
stands, and there he was baptised by St. Augustine, and
his example was followed by some, by no means all, of
his countrymen.


By this time the Saxons who had beaten Ethelbert at
Wimbledon had fallen out amongst themselves and were
disunited. Remember, they were half savages, and as
they had only come for plunder you can easily understand
that sooner or later they would be pretty sure to quarrel
about it. Ethelbert determined to take the opportunity
offered him of extending his kingdom, and was so successful
that the Kingdom of Kent extended as far as the Humber
in the north, across the Midlands to Sherwood, by the
western and southern borders of Northamptonshire to
Huntingdon, and by West Hertfordshire to the Thames,
Sussex, and the coast, calling himself Overlord of East
Anglia, that is, of Hertfordshire, Middlesex, and Essex, as
well as King of Kent.


So Kent became one of the three great divisions of
England, the other two being Northumbria and Wessex.  
  
  
  At about this time, 600, St. Martin's Church at  
  
  
  c 2
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 20 -->
Canterbury was given to Queen Bertha's chaplain. This is
probably the oldest church in England, for it is built of
Roman brick, and is said to date from A.D. 220. Augustine
was hard at work converting Kent whilst its king was
extending his kingdom. Ten thousand Kentishmen were
baptised in the river Swale; the Cathedral of Christ
Church at Canterbury was consecrated—not the splendid
building we know so well and are so proud of, but an old
Romano-British church, which lasted until the Danes
burned it in 1011; outside the city on the east was
founded the Benedictine Priory of SS. Peter and Paul—two
saints who give their names to a great many of our Kentish
churches—and which was afterwards the burial place of
the Kings of Kent. With this spread of Christianity
came a revival of the arts and sciences which civilise man,
and for the first time in our history England became
united to the older nations of Europe by ties stronger than
the ordinary ones of trade—by the ties of the possession of
the sams religion. Hear what Dean Stanley says about
this : —


\"From Canterbury, the first English Christian city; from
Kent, the first English Christian kingdom, has, by degrees,
arisen the whole constitution of Church and State in
England which now binds together the whole British
Empire."


But Pope Gregory was not content that Kent alone
should be Christian. He wanted to see the whole country
converted. Roedwald, King of East Anglia under
Ethelbert, became a Christian, but his people refused to
follow his example, and there was a revolution against
Ethelbert, which resulted in the loss of Middle England
and East England, all but Essex and Middlesex, and by
the date of King Ethelbert's death in 616 even these
were lost.


Ethelbert's son, Eadbald, who succeeded him, was a
heathen, and the people, who had never been really and
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 21 -->
thoroughly Christianised, became heathen again also,
although later on Christianity was re-established.


Then follows a series of Kings of Kent who were not
remarkable, and the kingdom gradually loses its importance,
the only event worthy of mention being a battle at Otford
in 774 between Aldric, King of Kent, and Offa, King of
Mercia, or Middle and Western England, in which the
Kentish King was beaten.


Egbert, King of Wessex—the south-west of England as
far as Cornwall—was now the rising power. In 815 he
conquered Cornwall, in 821 Mercia, in 823 his son
Ethelwulf conquered Kent, and by the dethronement of
Baldred the kingdom came to an end after an existence of
three hundred and sixty-eight years.


So now the three peoples which through all these long
years of bloodshed and misery had remained separate
powers, namely, the Angles, who were divided into the East
Angles, the Middle Angles, and the West Angles or
Mercians; the Saxons, who were East Saxons, West
Saxons, and South Saxons; the Jutes—who were in Kent
—became one people, and when Egbert, King of
Wessex, conquered Northumbria England became one
nation; although Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia
still elected their own kings, who paid tribute to Egbert.
And thus matters rested until the Danish invasion.


I am not going to keep you very long with the Danes.
Our county had its full share of the miseries which followed
the landings of this fierce people; our Kentish towns were
burned and sacked, our Kentish fields laid waste. In 893
Appledore was burned by the Danish chieftain Hasting,
and it is said that Ashford grew out of the ruins of Great
Chart, which was also burned. Alfred, however, beat them
the same year near Aylesford. Twice was Canterbury
plundered, and once was its Cathedral burned down. In
1016 there was a great fight at Otford, in which the Saxon
King Edmund Ironside defeated the Danes, but I should
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 22 -->
tire you to no purpose if I were to tell you of nothing but
these fightings and burnings and slayings, and after I had
finished I don't know that you would be much wiser than
you were before.


It was under its Saxon Kings that Kent was divided
into Laths—a division as peculiar to our county as Ridings
are to Yorkshire, Parts and Trithings to Lincolnshire, and
Rapes or Ropes to Sussex. Kent was divided into seven
Laths, each Lath into Hundreds consisting of a hundred
villages, or a hundred families, or a hundred hides of land
(a hide being an uncertain quantity of land—generally
believed to have been as much as was sufficient for one
plough to till), and each Hundred into boroughs of ten
freemen or heads of families. The n<ames still exist, and
in some cases even the actual old boundaries.


Penenden Heath, near Maidstone, of which we shall
speak more than once later on, was the great central
meeting place of the County, and here were held three
times a year the County Courts of Justice or Folk motes;
whilst the Witenagemote, or grand National Council, was
held at Easter and Christmas and met at no particular
place.
<!-- Leaf 39 -->
  
  CHAPTER IV.  
  
  
  THE NORMANS.


As you have read all about the famous battle of Hastings,
by which the Normans conquered our land from the Saxons,
I shall say little about it. But you may well be proud to
know that our Kentish men had won for themselves such
renown as warriors during the troublous times of the
Saxon Kings that they claimed the right of always being
placed in the very front of battle, and that they occupied
and splendidly maintained this position at the battle of
Hastings. Moreover, it is not generally told that the first
Norman blood was drawn by Kent men, for part of
William's fleet landed at Romney and were repulsed by
the men of that town.


Now, there are many books which tell you that after the
Battle of Hastings the men of Kent and the Kentish men
—the men of the Weald and the men of the rest of Kent—
ivon or forced certain rights and privileges from William
the Conqueror, and that in token of this the county bears
beneath its crest of the White Horse of Hengist the proud
motto Invicta; that is, Unconquered. Although I like to
believe as much as any of you anything which glorifies our
county of Kent, I should not be doing my duty to you if
I asked you to believe what is not true. It is said, for
instance, that those rights and privileges which Kent had
<!-- Leaf 40 -->
■7i  
  
  
  HISTORY OP KENT.

enjoyed under her own kings, and under the Saxon kings
who followed them, were extorted from William by threats;
that our Kentish men said, " If you don't let us keep these
rights and privileges we will make you." This is all
nonsense. Kent was as completely conquered as any other
part of England, and if William allowed its people to
retain old rights and privileges it was because it wiis to
his interest to treat the people he had conquered as quietly
and as kindly as was advisable, and we may be quite sure
that he did not let them retain any right or privilege
which was likely to be a danger to him.


Besides, when William beat the army of Harold he beat
the army at any rate of South England, and it is evident
that there was not much strength left to oppose him or he
could not have done as he did, march from Hastings to
London without striking a blow. From Sussex he went
into Kent, punished the men of Romney fur their
above-mentioned act, summoned Dover Castle to yield
and was obeyed, summoned Canterbury and was obeyed,
and then went on to London. There was plenty of pluck
amongst the people, but there was nobody to lead them.


Listen to what the greatest historian of this period of
our national history, Mr. Freeman, says :—


\"The Norman Conquest did little towards any abolition
(doing away with) of the older English laws and
institutions. But it set up some new institutions alongside
of old ones."  
  
  
  And again he says:
\"William did not abolish the old Kentish laws, but that
is because he did not do so anywhere else; nor is there
anything to show that he treated Kent better or worse
than the rest of the kingdom."


A condition of slavery existed in Kent as in other parts
of England, and we find that until so late as 1685 each
Kentish estate had its proportion of " bondsmen,
bondswomen, and villeins."
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 25 -->

The silliest of all the stories about Kent men being
unusually favoured by William I tell you here, not because
it is so silly, but because, as I have said before, I like you
to know all our old Kent traditions. They say that
Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, cand the Abbot of
St. Augustine's at Canterbury, assembled the Kent men at
Swanscombe, between Dartford and Northfleet, and, acting
as captains, ordered each man to get a green bough, and
for the whole body to march to where William was. It was
a superstitious age, that is to say, an age when everybody,
from highest to lowest, believed in ghosts and spirits and
mysteries, and the story says that William, seeing what
looked like a moving forest coming towards him, was
frightened. When the Kent menapproached they threw
aside their boughs, and, showing themselves fully armed,
gave him the choice of allowing them to keep all their
ancient rights and privileges or fighting. So he gave them
what they wanted.


There are two points in this story which I would like
you to note.


Firstly, the resemblance between this trick of the Kent
men and the trick pkayed by Macduff upon Macbeth in
Shakespeare's wonderful play of Macbeth. And secondly,
that two clergymen should act as soldiers.


Clergymen were constantly at the head of armies at this
time and for a long while after. Indeed, if a bishop could
not fight for his bishopric he stood a good chance of losing
it, for, although people were ruled by laws,  
  
  
  ' The good old rule sufficed, the simple plan,

That they should take who have the power,
And they should keep who can."


You will hear people talk about the Kentish Law of
Gavelkind as one of these rights won from William, but,
although I will not worry you about the law of
Gavelkind, which briefly means the division of property on
the death of a father amongst all the children equ.ally—first
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 26 -->
the sons and then the daughters—instead of, as is usu.al,
the greater part going to the eldest son, I may say that
this law was by no means peculiar to Kent in William's
time, although it is now.


Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, who did so much towards the
victory at Hastings, was made Earl of Kent by William,
and Hugh de Montfort was made governor of Dover, and
these two men behaved so brutally and tyrannically that
in 1067 the Kent men assembled on Penenden Heath,
near Maidstone, their ancient place of public meeting,
to consider what should be done. And they did
the worst thing they could, invited Eustace, Count of
Boulogne, who only hated Englishmen less than he hated
William, to come over and help them against the tyrants.
Eustace, who was one of the four knights who so cowardly
killed Harold at Hastings after the arrow had struck him,
came over, and with the Kent men attacked the great
castle which Odo had built at Rochester on the site of a
Roman and Saxon fortress, and they were utterly beaten,
so that this did not make matters smoother for the Kent
men with William.


However, to show that William, if severe against those
who opposed him, seems to have been just with those who
let him have his way, in 1072 he ordered the Kent
men to meet on Penenden Heath to judge in a dispute
between Odo of Bayeux and Archbishop Lanfranc about
some thefts of the latter's land made by the former, not as
bishop, but as Earl of Kent, and when the Kent men
decided that Odo was in the wrong, confirmed their decision,
and allowed it to be passed as law by the great Council of
the Kingdom.


It may be interesting for you to know that the population
of Kent at this time, according to the Domesday Book, was
twelve thousand two hundred—about the population of the
town of Ashford at this day.
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 27 -->

Wherever the Normans intended to settle they
strengthened themselves by the building of castles. As a
rule they made use of places where already Saxon, and even
Roman fortresses, had stood—Dover Castle, for instance,
was on a Saxon site, and the Saxons had built on a Roman
site. Rochester was the same. Allington, Canterbury,
Chilham, and Folkestone were built on Saxon sites.
Eynesford and Tong were probably pure Norman.


The church people too were active builders, and to the
Norman period we may date Canterbury Priory, Lesnes
Priory, and those at Boxley, Dover, Rochester, and
Faversham.


When you see ruins of buildings of this kind you become
doubly interested when you know exactly at what part you
are looking, and this is difficult to make out unless you
know something about the arrangement of Norman abbeys
and castles. So to help you I have drawn two plans, one
of an abbey and one of a castle, and as the Normans rarely
departed from a regular plan these may be useful.


So much interest surrounds many of our little Kentish
places which are associated with big events—Otford, for
instance, where already four battles have been fought—
that you may like to know that the little town of Wye,
near Ashford, with its lordship over twenty-two
\"Hundreds," and privileges extending over Folkestone,
Milton, and Chart, was given to Battle Abbey as an
\"endowment "—that is, as a means of putting money into
the Abbey chest—by William the Conqueror before any
other place.


There is nothing special to keep us during the reigns
of William Rufus and Henry I., but Kent under the
unhappy reign of Stephen comes to the fore. The chief—
nay, the only event of this time was the war which Stephen
and his spirited wife M.atilda carried on against Maud, the
cousin of Stephen. It was about the crown of England.
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 28 -->
Stephen's father was the husband of William the
Conqueror's daughter Adela. Maud was the great
grand-daughter in a direct line of William, and was
regarded as the natural heiress to the throne. But Stephen,
who w,as a bad man, procured false evidence that Henry I.,
the last king, had said that for some bad behaviour or
other his daughter Maud should not be Queen of England,
and so he was allowed to become King, got hold of the late
king's treasure at Winchester, and was crowned with
Matilda in 1136, the great barons backing him up.


But Maud was not going to be quietly cheated of her
rights like this. The people of England were not on her
side, but she tried to take Normandy, which, as you of
course know, was then a part of the dominion of our kings.
She failed to do this. Stephen's brother and all the church
people—very rich and powerful they were too—were on
Maud's side, and war was declared against Stephen. Dover
and Leeds Castles were taken from him. He won them
back, but he was afterwards taken prisoner at Lincoln, and
Maud was declared queen.


London and Kent alone stood up in this extremity for
Stephen, whose queen, Matilda, and son, Eustace, went into
Kent. Meanwhile Maud's insolent behaviour disgusted her
o
friends, and Stephen's side got stronger. Maud escaped to
Oxford, then to Winchester, the men of London and Kent
after her, and very nearly caught her. Her men were beaten
in a fight; she fled back to Oxford, where she was besieged by
the Londoners and Kent men, and only escaped by dressing
herself in white and getting off in the snow.


So the Kent men helped Stephen to the throne. I don't
know that there is much to be proud of in the act, for
England would probably have been much happier without
him. He founded Faversham Abbey, and was buried
there, as were his wife and his son, although their bones
were afterwards taken out and thrown into Faversham

was very fond of Faversham and spent much time there, so

<!-- Leaf 48 -->
  
  CHAPTER V.  
  
  
  THE PLANTAGENETS.  
  
  
  Henry IL—1154-1189.


Although the county of Kent plays no more prominent
part in the history of our country under the first
Plantagenet King, Henry the Second—grandson of Henry
the First—than any other, it is at any rate the most
intimately connected with the life of the most famous
Englishman of the day, Thomas a Becket, Archbishop of
Canterbury, and the stories and legends about him in Kent
are innumerable. The Kent men throughout stood up for
the Archbishop in his long quarrel with the king as to
whether the order of clergymen was to enjoy its ancient
privileges or not, for the people of England as a rule very
much preferred the rule of the Church—that is to say, of
the great abbots and priors, whose magnificent abbeys and
priories did for this people almost all that schools and
hospitals do for them nowadays, to the stern, wicked, cruel
dominion of the great nobles who were backed up by the
king.


\"The men of Kent," says Mrs. Green in her little book
about this reign, "held the outposts of the county as the
advanced guard formally charged with the defence of its
shores from foreign invasion, which was a very present
terror in those days And it seems as if the shire
very early took up the part it was to play again and again
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 31 -->
in mediæval history, and even later, as the assertor and
defender of popular privileges."


Thomas a Becket was personally beloved by the Kent
men. When business took him from place to place he
travelled magnificently and slowly,—magnificently, as
became the first subject in the kingdom; slowly, because it
was impossible to travel quickly on the Kentish roads of
Henry the Second's time.


He had splendid palaces at Canterbury, Maidstone,
Charing, Otford, and Knole, and smaller resting houses at
Ford, Chart, Chartham, Teynham, Wingham, and
Wrotham. At Otford people still show you St. Thomas's
Well, w*hich he is said to have caused to bubble up, and the
ivy-covered ruins of his palace. They also s<ay that no
nightingales ever sing at Otford because they disturbed
the great Archbishop at his prayers.


I have, I think, already mentioned that the clergy of
these days were, in defence of their own rights or to gratify
their ambition, as often soldiers as not. I have read that
Thomas a Becket, when Archdeacon of Canterbury, served
in the army which King Henry collected for the purpose of
conquering the earldom of Toulouse, and that he kept up
at his own cost seven hundred horsemen and one thousand
foot.


The real beginning of his long quarrel with the king was
also a military affair, Becket claiming the castles of
Rochester, Siiltwood, Hythe, and Tonbridge as having
always belonged to the See of Canterbury.


Finally, <as you know, he was murdered in Canterbury
Cathedral, but perhaps you do not know that the four
knights who murdered him arranged their plans at the
Castle of Saltwood, to which many of you must have gone
from Folkestone, and that they galloped thence on their
wicked errand along the old Roman Stone Street about
which I told you defore.  
  
  
  After his death his shrine—that is, the altar standing
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 32 -->
over his tomb and containing his relics—became the
object of pilgrimages for the highest and noblest, as well as
the middle class and the poor, from all parts of England
find even the continent, the presents and offerings made
being of the richest description. Pilgrims from London
and the continent came along Watling Street, but pilgrims
from the south-west of England came along a quiet,
secluded road which is still called " The Pilgrims' Way,"
or "The Old Pilgrim," and which is still traced by the
dotted clumps of yew trees from where it enters Kent at
Tatsfield, iibove Westerham, to Charing and Eastwell
Park. I daresay it can be followed further on the way to
Canterbury than this, but, although I have tried four or
five times to do so, I have failed.


In Appendix A, as I have said before, I try to show you
how Royal a county ours is, but everybody doesn't know
that in a tower of Westenhanger House—that picturesque
pile of old buildings which you see on your right hand
sitting with your face to the engine on the way from
London to Dover just before you come to Westenhanger
station—Henry the Second used to meet and court fair
Rosamond before he removed her to Woodstock.  
  
  
  RichardI.—1189-1199.


In 11S9 Richard held a great council of the kingdom
at Canterbury, at which William, King of Scotland,
attended to pay homage. After this Richard started from
Dover for the Crusades. On his return to Engkand after
his imprisonment in Germany—you know the story about
the minstrel Blondel—he walked from Sandwich to
Canterbury in humble dress by way of thanksgiving for his
escape.  
  
  
  John—1199-1215.


This bad king had one or two important dealings with
our county.


John had himself crowned a second time at Canterbury
in 1201 just to spite the Archbishop, who had kept
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 33 -->
Christmas there in a style more suited to a king than a
clergyman, by putting him to great expense. In 1203
John kept Christmas in great state at Canterbury. He
was very fond, too, of Chilham Castle.


In 1213 the Cinque Ports fleet captured a French fleet
and burned a hundred ships—but there is more about our
Kentish navy under the next reign.


On Barham Downs (or at Temple, near Ewell), a place
famous for the assembling of armies, John met Pandulph,
the Pope's legate—which means messenger—who had come
to tell the king that he was no longer to reign over
England as he persisted in refusing to have the man
whom the Pope wished to be Archbishop of Canterbury,
the great Stephen Langton, and defied him. At this
time you know England, being a Roman Catholic country,
was almost as much under the rule of the Pope of
Rome as of her ow*n kings, who until the middle of Henry
the Eighth's reign dared not disobey him, so that John
in defying the Pope was guilty of what was then considered
a terrible crime.


John thought Stephen Langton was a dangerous man—
that is, a man who would stand up for the peojjle against
him, and so he refused to allow him to be Archbishop of
Canterbury. The Pope was very angry and excommunicated
him—deprived him of all the rights as a churchman,
and ordered him to give up his crown. John refused to do
so. So the Pope published a crusade against him—told
the people of Europe that it was a great and holy duty to
make war on him, and selected Philip, King of France, as
the man to do it.


Philip gathered an army to invade England, and John
gathered an army of 60,000 men to meet him, again on
Barham Downs.


Then suddenly, John, frightened at the terrible thing
he had done in refusing to obey the greatest m-in in
Christendom, and, as he was a bad king, not at all sure  
  
  
  i>
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 34 -->
that his own people would stand by him in a fight with the
King of France, submitted, and at the house of the Knights
Templars, near Dover, resigned his crown into the Pope's
legate's hands, and received it back as a vassal—that is,
as a man who pays duty to a superior.


The people of England, however, were very angry at this
cowardly act of the king's, and the result of their anger
was Magna Charta, 1215.


Kent was faithful to John throughout the war between
him and the barons. The barons invited Louis, the eldest
son of the King of France, to be King of England, and he
set sail with seven hundred ships in 1216. Stormy
weather and the Cinque Ports fleet, however, stopped him
for a while, but he afterwards landed at Stonar, took
Canterbury and Rochester—which had already stood a
famous siege against John—and then the Kent men,
except Dover and the Cinque Ports, turned against the
king and declared for Louis. Louis went on to London,
and acted for some time as King of England.


John's death put an end to the miseries of civil war, but
things were beginning to look better for him.  
  
  
  Henry III.—1215-1272.


Louis resumed his attempts to increase his power in
England and went to France for more soldiers, but public
opinion was in favour of the young king, and the Cinque
Ports fleet was sent to oppose the landing of Louis. He
however, landed at Sandwich, burned the town, but
was defeated at Lincoln, and asked his father for more
help.


In this reign may be considered to have begun the growth
of our glorious empire of the sea, for in 1217 the Cinque
Ports fleet under Hubert de Burgh met the French fleet
coming with the reinforcements which Louis had asked of
his father, and, although the French had eighty ships and
the English foi'ty, only fifteen French ships escaped.  
  
  
  As it may interest you to hear what a sea fight of seven
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 35 -->
hundred years ago was like, I give you a description by
the famous old chronicler Froissart :-tt


\"The bowmen and archers began the engagement with a
volley of arrows; as soon as their ships came in contact they
were fastened together with chains and hooks; powder of
quick lime was scattered in the air that it might be carried
by the wind into the eyes of the enemy, and the English,
leaping on board with axes in their hands, rendered the
ships unmanageable by cutting away the rigging."


Now, the early glories of the English navy were won
by Cinque Ports ships—ships belonging to the five
ports of Dover, Sandwich, Hythe, Romney, and Hastings
—for the most part Kentish ships, manned by Kentish
men, and paid for in Kentish-earned money. I want to
impress upon you that this Cinque Ports navy was the
Royal Navy of England and the only bulwark against
foreign invasion for hundreds of years, so that if a Kent
man had nothing else to be proud of he might always and
for ever boast of this great honour for our county.


Now, please turn to Appendix B and read what I say
there about the Cinque Ports.


After the beating above referred to the French made
peace, and Louis left England.


Henry married Eleanor of Provence at Canterbury, and
in 1220 the magnificent shrine in the cathedral received
the bones of Thomas a Becket.


One of the Acts of the Parliament of Oxford held in 1258
was that the Castle of Dover and fourteen others and the
Cinque Ports should be commanded by natives of England
—important as showing that the people were beginning to
show a national feeling, and were soon to declare themselves
English and nothing else. Another Act was that the king
should faithfully observe Magna Charta, but the king
broke his word, and the barons declared war against him.


Simon de Montfort is the principal figure of this reign,
and, although not an Englishman by birth, is worthy of all  
  
  
  d 2
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 36 -->
honour as the chief champion of the liberties of the people
against the tyranny of the crown.


Before the war actually broke out the dispute between
the king and the barons was referred to the King of
France, who was to settle who was right. His decision
was that the barons wanted too much, and he particularly
condemned their demand about the command of the
Kentish castles. The barons did not choose to obey
his decision, so war was declared, Kent and the Cinque
Ports being for the barons.


Rochester again sustained a famous siege by the barons,
but Henry relieved the city, took Tonbridge Castle, and
marched towards the coast in the hope that the Cinque
Ports would be terrified into joining him. On his way he
executed three hundred men at Flimwell because a
countryman h.ad killed his cook !


The Cinque Ports declined to help him, so he went on
burning, destroying, and skaying through the Weald of
Kent.


In 1264 the barons' army met the king's at Lewes,
utterly defeated it, and took the king prisoner. His sons,
the Princes Henry and Edward, were sent to Dover, and
De Montfort himself took charge of the king, and indeed
held an almost royal court at Canterbury.


This great victory is doubly important, for not only was
it a triumph of liberty against oppression, but it led to the
calling together of our first English parliament, of the first
assembly wherein merchant and trader sat side by side
with knight and baron. This was in 1264.


But Queen Eleanor stirred up war again on behalf of the
king. The Pope excommunicated the barons and placed
the Cinque Ports under an interdict, which means that he
exhorted all people to regard them as unworthy of
belonging to the Church, and to do them all the harm they
could. De Montfort assembled an army on Barham Downs
\"Such a multitude of horsemen and footmen were assembled
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 37 -->
as a man would not have thought possible to have been
found in the whole realm." But nothing came of it
all. In 1265 De Montfort and the barons at Evesham
were beaten by Prince Edward, who had escaped from
Dover, and De Montfort was killed. The people, however,
long reverenced his memory as their champion, and healing
miracles were performed by a " measure," or a belt,
which had been round his body.


This Prince Edward, afterwards to be King Edward I.,
received the submission of the barons of the Cinque Ports
at their ancient place of meeting, Shepway, near Lympne,
and punished some of their mariners, who, rather than do
nothing, had been lately committing piratical outrages
on the seas.  
  
  
  Edward I.—1272-1307.


In 1287 occurred the great storm which so altered the
course of the river Rother that it no longer flowed into the
sea at New Romney, but at Rye in Sussex, destroyed the
towns of Old Winchelsea, Broomhill, Oswardstone, and
Dengemarsh by washing away the bank of shingle on
which they stood and which stretched across what is now
called Rye Harbour.


In 1293 the English fleet—no doubt the Cinque Ports
fleet, for the gallant west country had not yet become a
nursery for sea heroes—numbering a hundred vessels, met
and defeated a French fleet of twice the size. In 1294
fifty Kentish gentlemen accompanied the king to the siege
of Caerlaverock, in Scotland, (Caerlaverock is believed to
be the original of the Castle of Ellangowan, about which
you read in Sir Walter Scott's " Guy Mannering.")


In 1295 Philip, King of France, sent a fleet of three
hundred ships up the Channel with the object of landing
troops and destroying towns. One ship, acting as a scout,
got to Hythe. The Kent men pretended to run away, the
Frenchmen landed, then the Kent men suddenly turned,
{empty}.slew two hundred and fifty of the Frenchmen and burned
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 38 -->
their ship, for which the French admiral landed at Dover
and plundered the town and priory, but the sturdy
countrymen came back in the evening and drove the French
back to their ships with the loss of eight hundred men.


In 1299 the king made a journey through Kent, and
from the dates of his arrival at the different places it seems
that our Kentish roads had been somewhat improved. He
went from Canterbury to Dover in one day, and from
Dover to Wye in one, and thence to Charing, Smarden,
Cranbrook, Sissinghurst, Mayfield, Wateringbury, Leeds,
and arrived at Canterbury on the twenty-fourth day.
Seventeen " guides " were employed on this journey. In
1302 he made another Kentish journey, and gave, we are
told, three pounds, modern value, a day in charity.


In 1305 the Prince of Wales was banished from the
court by his father for some irregularity in which he and
his friend Piers Gaveston were concerned, and he spent his
time in Kent and Sussex—Wye and Tenterden being
visited.  
  
  
  Edward IL—1307-1327.


The chief Kentish event of this reign was the rebellion—
for it was nothing else—of Lord Badlesmere against the
king, together with the Earl of Lancaster and the barons.
He had been steward of the royal household, and so was a
man of great influence, and had obtained the royal castle
at Leeds in exchange for other lands. At any rate, the
king wanted to get Leeds back, and sent his queen, Isabella,
daughter of Philip le Bel, of France, to ask lodging there
with a large train of attendants, pretending that she was
going on a pilgrimage to Canterbury. Lord Badlesmere
was Eiway from Leeds at the time, but the ladies of this age
showed themselves equal to take the places of their lords in
times of trouble, and Lady Badlesmere, suspecting that
Queen Isabella's visit h.ad another meaning, refused to
admit her, fired on her men and killed some of them.  
  
  
  So King Edward marched to Leeds, and Lady Badlesmere,
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 39 -->
after showing fight for a while, surrendered. The king
took severe vengeance on the garrison. Colepeper, whom
Lord Badlesmere had entrusted with the care of his wife,
children, and castle, was hung, Lady Badlesmere was sent
to the Tower of London, and the king seized the castle,
together with those at Chilham and Tonbridge, which were
also Lord Badlesmere's.


Meanwhile Lord Badlesmere and the other barons were
in alliance with the Scots against the king, who marched
against them at Boroughbridge in Yorkshire, defeated
them, executed all the leaders, and crushed the rebellion.  
  
  
  Edward III.—1327-1377.


This is a particularly interesting reign to us. Edward
the Black Prince married Joane, sister of John Plantagenet,
Earl of Kent, known as the Fair Maid of Kent, and their
son became Richard the Second. After the great victory
at Poictiers, 1356, Edw-ird landed at Sandwich—which was
then at the height of its importance as a place of business
and a port—with his prisoner, King John of France, and
thence, after the famous entry into London, at which the
prisoner rode on a splendid horse, whilst his conqueror rode
beside him on a smaller and commoner—he brought John
to the royal palace at Eltham, and in that hall which from
a distance looks like a barn, but which is so beautiful w*ithin,
he feasted him and waited on him. From this circumstance
it is called King John's palace to this day, although our
King John had no more to do with it than you or I.


Now, does not the knowledge of that single incident make
that old building ten times more interesting to you than it
was before 1 And I shall tell you in their proper places of
other things connected with Eltham Palace which will
make you feel as I do, that it is one of the most interesting
places in England.


The Black Prince died at the Archbishop's Palace at
Canterbury, after having tried the effects of the waters of
that well at Harbledown which is still called " The Black
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 40 -->
Prince's Well," and was buried, as you know, in the
cathedral, his tomb being the chief object of interest to
visitors from all parts of the world.


In 1348 the terrible Black Death, a plague which is said
by some to have originated in China, ravaged England,
and especially the southern and eastern parts. It does not
seem to have been so bad in Kent as in the eastern
counties, p<articularly Norfolk, but it must have been very
violent, for w*e read of whole districts going out of
cultivation, and of grass growing in the streets of many of
our towns; and during the years 1348 and 1349 three
Archbishops of Canterbury were elected, two of whom died
of the plague. Remember, that in those days there were
no hospitals worthy of the name—at any rate in the
country districts, and that the art of healing was very
rough and ready, so that when a disease like this plague
once got a hold upon a country it had to run its course.


One serious result of the plague was that the land was
over-run by men who had been ruined and men out of
work, as well as by all sorts of rogues and vagabonds.
Parliament, intending to remedy this state of things,
passed a law in 1349 called the Statute of Labourers, by
which every man or woman of whatever condition, free or
bond, able in body and not more than sixty years old, and
not having a livelihood or land to cultivate, should be
obliged to serve any employer who should require them,
and should take the wages customary in the neighbourhood.
John Ball, a wandering preacher of Kent, who would in
these days be called a Socialist, spoke violently against this
enslaving of the people by Act of Parliament, taking as his
text :  
  
  
  "When Adam delved and Eve span,

Who was then the gentleman ?"

meaning that God had made us all equal, and that kings
and rulers had no right to go against what God had done
by making the poor slaves to the rich.
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 41 -->

The feeling he excited amongst his country listeners had
a good de<al to do in bringing about the rebellion of Wat
Tyler in the next reign.


It was under Edward the Third that Kent became
famous as an industrial centre, and it is strange to note the
changes brought about when we think that the north
of England, which in Edward the Third's reign was little
batter than a wilderness, should now, thanks to the
development of its coal fields, be the manufacturing part
of our country, whilst the south nowadays has comparatively
no manufactures at all.


By this reign the great forest, about which I told you in
the first chapter as covering the greater part of West Kent
called the Weald, had been pretty well cleared, and
amongst these " dens " or hollows the clothmaking industry
was introduced in 1337 by Flemings, that is, Dutchmen,
seventy families of whom were invited to settle by Edward.
Cranbrook was chosen as the centre of the trade on account
of its excellent fuller's earth—used in the manufacture of
woollens—but Goudhurst, Hawkhurst, and Biddenden were
busy places, and I have read that Queen Elizabeth once
walked from Cranbrook to Coursehorne Manor, a distance
of one mile, entirely upon broad cloth woven at Cranbrook.


In 1353 the Staple—the place where wool had to be
brought for payment of customs before it could be
exported or sold- -was changed from the towns of Flanders
to certain of England, and amongst them Canterbury,
and so trade was established which flourished down to the
end of the eighteenth century.


In 1340 the English won a great naval victory off Sluys,
Two hundred and forty English ships beat four hundred
French with forty thousand men on board. Two hundred
and thirty French ships were taken, and it is said thirty
thousand Frenchmen were killed.  
  
  
  And in 1350 there was a battle off Winchelsea, in which
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 42 -->
both the king and the Black Prince took part, and which
ended in a great defeat of the Spani.ards.


I would like you to note that the difference between
Normans and S<axons which was so strongly marked at the
beginning of John's reign, 1200, had entirely disappeared
by the beginning of the reign of Edward the Third—that
is, in a hundred and thirty years, and that we became
simply Englishmen.


Also, that this was the reign of Geoffrey Chaucer, who,
although a Londoner by birth, was a knight of the shire
for Kent, probably lived in Kent; at any rate, knew Kent,
and is rendered immortal by his story of a Kentish
Pilgrimage.  
  
  
  Richard IL—1377-1399.


Our county is brought prominently into historical notice
during this reign by the rebellion of Wat Tyler. I cannot
give you a good reason, but Kent always seems to have
come to the fore in matters pertaining to the liberties of
the people, so that more popular rebellions and agitations
have begun in Kent than in any other county. At any
rate, to this day strangers to Kent always remark that
nowhere else, except in Northumberland and Cumberland,
are they so impressed by the general independence of
manner and speech, a peculiarity which they call, rightly
or wrongly it is not for me, a Kentishman, to decide,
insolence. And yet, as you know very well, Kent is the
only solid Conservative county in England.


The immediate cause of Wat Tyler's rebellion was the
miserable failure of the war with France after the death of
the Black Prince, which led to the levying of a Poll Tax—
that is, a tax upon every " head " of the people, no distinction
being made between the rich and poor, so that the
ploughman paid just as much as the nobleman. But the
feeling that the people were not fairly dealt with by the
richer classes and the government had, as I said in the last
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 43 -->
chapter, been long smouldering. Now it burst forth into a
blaze.


Really the explosion first occurred in Essex, where one of
the collectors of the Poll Tax got roughly handled for
misbehaving himself, but the scene of real business was in Kent.


Ball, the preacher of whom I told you, was imprisoned
at Canterbury. The Kent men released him, and plundered
the Archbishop's palace—one of those stupid, wanton acts
by which mobs have so often made enemies of people
who sympathise with them and would help them. One
hundred thousand men gathered round Wat Tyler on
Blackheath, intending to march on to London. Whilst
they were encamped there the Princess of Wales, mother of
the young king, happened to be returning from a pilgrimage
to Canterbury, but the mob did not interfere with her,
although it is said one man asked her to give him a kiss, and
she went on.


Wat Tyler and his men marched on London, and the
example set by Kent wtas followed by Norfolk, Suffolk,
Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, Surrey, and
Sussex, in all of which counties the people rose to arms.
The Kent men crossed the Thames, burned the houses of
rich people, but committed few robberies—indeed, one man
caught stealing was hung on the spot—and went on to the
Tower of London. From this fortress they dragged out
Archbishop Sudbury and others who were known to be
concerned in the levying of the hateful tax and beheaded them.


King Richard, a boy of sixteen, met a number of the
rebels at Mile End, and asked them what they wanted.
They replied, " A general pardon, the abolition of slavery,"
for, in spite of Magna Charta, the condition of the lower
classes was little better than slavery—" That the rent of
good land should be fourpence an acre, and that all
men should have liberty to buy and sell at fairs
and markets." All this the king granted. Then he
went on into the city to Smithfield, where he met
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 44 -->
that portion of the rebels who had been at the Tower.
Wat Tyler dame forward, having given oi'ders that at a sign
from him they should kill all the king's people, but not the
king himself. As he behaved in a very insolent manner
in the presence of the king Sir William Walworth, Lord
Mayor of London, knocked him down, and the attendants
killed him. This made the rebels furious, and they drew
their bows to avenge the death of their leader, when the
boy king, with wonderful pluck and presence of mind,
stepped forward and said :—


\"Good people, you want a leader; I will be your
leader ! "


And this won the hearts of the Kent men. They dropped
their bows, followed the king into the fields, and were
allowed to go with the s*ime promises which had been made
to the Mile End men.


But as soon as the nobility and gentry saw that the mob
was dispersed, and not at all liking the promises which had
been made by the king, they took arms, hunted the rebels
down, killed many of them, the promises were set aside as
worth nothing, and the people were no better off than they
had been before.  
  
  
  House of Lancaster.
Henry IV—1399-1413.


In the year 1406 the Cinque Ports navy, under Henry
Page, surprised and took one hundred and twenty French
merchant ships " laden with salt, iron, oyle, and no worse
merchandise."


It was in this reign that the Prince of Wales,afterwards
Henry the Fifth, played the trick of pretending to rob
Falstaff on Gads Hill, outside Rochester, about which some
day you will read with great delight in Shakespeare's
famous play of " Henry the Fourth."  
  
  
  Henry V—1413-1422.


In your Shakespeare you will read that it was from
Hampton that King Henry sailed with the gallant army
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 45 -->
which was to win the glorious victory of Agincourt, but all
the older copies say that it was from Dover. At any rate,
it was at Dover that he landed after the victory, and, I
quote from Dr. Lingard's History, " The crowd plunged into
the waves to meet him, and the conqueror was carried in
their arms from his vessel to the beach." At Blackheath
he was met by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London
with four hundred citizens " clothed in scarlet."


At the battle of Agincourt Sir Thomas Erpingham led
three hundred Kentish bowmen of his own training, and
right well the3T acquitted themselves against the French.
Their banner had on it a wood (Swanscombe Wood) with
an arm holding a sword above the word " Invicta."  
  
  
  Henry VI.—1422-1461.


Kent, the great manufacturing district of England,
suffered very much from the ill success of the French war—
(the fifth period of the Hundred Years War, between 1429
and 1453). Joan of Arc had defeated the English before
Orleans, and we had been beaten at the battle of
Fourmigny. This brought about the " Complaint of the
Commons of Kent," a loud and fierce call for reform, which
complained that the king made improper use of the money
collected from the people, that the tax collectors were
insolent and dishonest, and that the people were vexed by
being compelled to travel from the farthest parts of West
Kent to East Kent to attend the sessions of justice. The
Statute of Labourers was condemned also, and it was
accompanied in 1450 by a gathering of armed Kent men
under Jack Cade, said by some to be an Ashford man and
by others an Irishman. Dick the Butcher, of Ashford, in
Shakespeare's play of " King Henry the Sixth," makes fun
of Cade's name, which means the old Kentish fish measure,
a cask, from the Latin word cadus, smaller than a barrel,
and holding six hundred herrings.


Cade marched to Sevenoaks, where he met and beat the
Royal forces sent against him, and encamped on Blackheath
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 46 -->
preparatory to marching to London. The " complaint" was
well received by the parliament, and a pardon granted to
Cade and his men, whereupon they broke up and went
home. But the government did exactly as they did
with Wat Tyler's men, refused to grant what they
had promised, and offered a reward for Cade's head.
He ran away, and was killed by Alexander Iden, a Kentish
esquire, some people say at Heathfield in Sussex, where
you may see a monument raised on the spot on which
is written " Near this spot was slain the notorious rebel
Jack Cade by Alexander Iden, Esquire, Sheriff of Kent,
{empty}A.D. 1450. His body was carried to London and his head
fixed on London Bridge. This is the success of all rebels,
and this fortune chanceth ever to traitors." But some of
us Kent men with a good deal of reason believe that the
place is Hothfield, near Ashford. Firstly, because Cade
would naturally fly to his friends in Ashford; and
secondly, because Iden's home was at Ripley Court, near
Westwell.


Jack Cade's men have been called the " scum of Kent,"
but we find that so far from this being the case there were
amongst them one knight, eighteen esquires, seventy-four
gentlemen, and five clergymen.


One quarter of his body was sent to Blackheath, one to
Norwich, one to Salisbury, and one to Gloucester.


Then the king went into Kent, executed twenty-six of
the leaders, and on his return the men of Kent met him at
Blackheath, naked save their shirts, and begged his pardon
on their knees.


You know that the name of Lollards was given to the
followers of the great Reformer Wycliffe,—a name derived,
it is said, from their practise of singing dirges at funerals,
the German word for singing slowly being lollen, and
that these people were cruelly persecuted at this time.
The first Lollard martyr was a Kent man named White,
who was burned at Norwich in 1428, and the Archbishops
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 47 -->
of Canterbury were the chief persecutors of men who
dared to believe what Wycliffe taught—the right of
private opinion in religious matters, and the teaching of
the Bible to the people in their own language. Sir John
Oldcastle, called " the good Lord Cobham," was a champion
of the Lollards, assembled them at Cobham for worship,
and was therefore burnt in 1417.


We now come to a period of English history more
difficult to understand than any other—even more than
very much older periods—the times of the Wars of the
Roses, during which the whole country from end to end
was so torn and disturbed and upset by the terrible fighting
that the ordinary life of men was almost paralysed, lands
remained uncultivated, business and trade were at a
standstill, nobody wrote records, most of the oldest English
families disappeared, never to rise again; and in short, the
whole nation was dislocated and convulsed. It is such a
melancholy repetition of the story of misery and bloodshed
that, although I must tell you all that concerns the county
of Kent during this strife, I shall be very brief.


After the defeat of the Yorkists—the White Rose
people—at the battle of Bloreheath in 1459, the Earls
of Warwick and Salisbury fled to France. Next year
they landed in Kent, and the people took up arms for
them because they felt that King Henry the Sixth, who
was by name king only, was utterly unfit to rule the
country, and a Kentish army entered London, obtained
more men, and took up a position to prevent the Red Rose
people, or Lancastrians, who had beaten the Yorkists at
Wakefield from coming to London. But they were beaten
by the Lancastrians under Queen Margaret at St. Albans,
1461, and if the Lancastrians had at once marched on
instead of wasting time in executing prisoners they could
have got to London. As it was, the Earl of Warwick's
army of Kent men and Londoners were able to bar the
road, and as young Edward, Duke of York, afterwards
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 48 -->
Edward IV., came up on the other side of her, fresh from
his victory at Mortimer's Cross over Jasper Tudor, she was
obliged to turn back northwards.


The Yorkist army of Kent men and Londoners followed
her, and beat her at Towton, the result of which was that
Edward became King Edward the Fourth of England. We
know that Kent men took part in this great victory (which
has been called the " Pharsalia of England," because the
result of it was like the result of the great battle fought
{empty}B.C. 48 between Julius Cæsar and his rival Pompey, by
which Cæsar became absolute master of the Roman
world), for masses were ordered to be said for the souls of
Kent men killed in the battle in Ashford church by the
will of Sir John Fogge, and we read that Robert Home, one
of the Homes of Appledore, was killed. Moreover, the poet
Drayton records how bravely Lord Cobham's Kentish
bowmen fought against the Lancastrians.  
  
  
  
House of York.
Edward IV—1461-1485.


\"In 1470," the old chronicle writer Holinshed says, " The
Kent men, whose minds be ever movable at the change of
princes, go to London, rob, kill, and release prisoners from
the King's Bench, and would have gone further had not
Warwick crushed them."


This is one of those unaccountable changes of feeling which
seem to have been so common in those days of general
confusion, for you see Warwick had to " crush " the very
men who had greeted him when he landed in Kent, and
who followed him to London and Yorkshire. The fact was
that the Earl of Warwick, the " king maker " as he was
called, who had, as we have seen, been an enemy of
Margaret, suddenly turned to her side and promised to put
her husband, Henry the Sixth, on the throne again.


In 1471 a pretender named Falconbridge landed in Kent.
The Kent men sided with him and took Sandwich Castle.
Edward the Fourth came into Kent, re-took Sandwich
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 49 -->
Castle, although it was bravely defended, and captured
thirteen ships, and Kent became the scene of merciless
executions, especially at Canterbury (where the Mayor was
beheaded), Rochester, and Blackheath.


Romney Marsh is even now unknown to a great number
of Kentish people, so that in the days of Edward IV. it
must have been still more remote. I have told you that
the Romans probably first turned the muddy morass into
pasture land by building walls and draining, but it would
seem to have become neglected and deserted by Edward
IV.'s reign, so to induce people to settle there he offered
great privileges.


Before the reign of Henry the Third, that is, before 1215,
the Marsh people had elected their own governors and
levied their own taxes, and to these Edward added other
benefits, and confirmed all the ancient rights.


So Romney Marsh is to-day ruled exactly as it was ruled
perhaps seven hundreds years ago—by a bailiff, "jurats,'1
and twenty-three owners of lands or manors near the
Marsh called " lords," the only difference being that
whereas there were twenty-four "jurats" in old days there
are but five now. The Grand Lath, or " meeting," is still
held at Dymchurch on the Thursday in Whitsun week, and
four petty Laths are held quarterly. At these meetings—
in a quaint old house called " New Hall "—all the business
of the Marsh, of its drainage, of Dymchurch sea wall, and
the raising of money by " scots," or rates, is done.


I am particular in telling you things like this, because
this is an age of change, and, although I do not think for a
moment that the government of Romney Marsh will be
altered, I want to impress upon you the importance of
becoming familiar with all matters of old fashion because
they are so rapidly disappearing.  
  
  
  Richard III.—1483-1485.


During this reign Henry of Richmond, afterwards King
Henry the Seventh, thought that the men of Kent were  
  
  
  E

the fittest to help him in his plan of t4aking the kingdom
from the wicked usurper Richard, and they assembled at
Maidstone under Richard Guildsord, but the time was not
ripe for such a movement and nothing came of it.


You know that Richard was killed at the battle of
Bosworth. Well, in the year 1720 there was accidentally
discovered in the Register of Deaths of Eastwell church
the following :—


\"Richard Plantagenet was buryed the 22nd daye of
December, 1550," followed by a peculiar mark which is only
put in registers after the names of royal or noble people.
This old man, for he was about eighty, is said to have been
a son of King Richard, and had fled to Eastwell upon
hearing that his father had lost the battle of Bosworth and
had been killed.

  CHAPTER VI.  
  
  
  THE TUDORS.  
  
  
  Henry VIL—1485-1509.


In the year 1495 the Kent men had a chance of
practically showing their loyalty, and they took it. Perkin
Warbeck, who pretended to be Richard, Duke of
York, one of the two young princes who htad been
smothered in the Tower of London by their uncle;
Richard the Third, so everybody believed, collected a gang
of rascals and thought he would try the effect of a landing
in Kent. He arrived off Deal and sent a number of his
followers ashore to report upon the feeling of the county
before he would risk himself. The gentlemen of Kent,
always ready ata moment's notice to arm themselves
agfiinst invaders, assembled and went to Deal. They
wanted to get hold of Warbeck himself so they invited him
to land, but he, suspecting a trap, declined; the Kent
men attacked his followers, killed some, and took two
hundred and fifty prisoners, who were afterwards executed.
Henry was very pleased at this, and rewarded the loyal
Kent men handsomely.  
  
  
  PLAMMOCK'S REBELLION. 1497.


People knew that the king was saving up money, and
were tired of being so frequently commanded to grant him
loans and subsidies—that is, to lend him money which they  
  
  
  e 2
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 52 -->
did not always get back. When Parliament ordered the
raising of money for the war with Scotland the Cornishmen
(who were very like our Kent men in their sturdy resistance
against all attacks on the rights and the liberties of the
people) were roused to anger. Flammock, a lawyer, argued
that properly speaking the border counties of
Northumberland, Cumberland,and Durham should defend the border,
and that counties hundreds of miles away should no more
be expected to pay for war against the Scots than the border
counties should be taxed to pay for the defence of the
southern coast. The Cornishmen asked to be led into Kent
\"as the people there were the freest in England " and
would certainly help them. But Henry had so graciously
rewarded the Kent men for their behaviour against
Warbeck that they were loyal and would do nothing
for the Cornishmen. The Cornishmen, numbering six
thousand, encamped on Blackheath. Henry sent out a
force of troops to meet them, but the Cornish men, being
ill-armed and ill-disciplined, no doubt disheartened at the
coldness of the people of Kent, and very likely homesick,
were soon beaten and scattered, but were gently dealt with
by the king—that is to say, comparatively so. Flammock
and Joseph, another leader, were hanged, and as two
thousand Cornishmen had been killed in the fight the
punishment was considered sufficient.  
  
  
  Henry VIII.—1502-1547.


\"Bluff King Hal," as some people still like to call him,
born and baptised at Greenwich, had a good deal to do
with Kent during his long reign.


In 1524 Henry wanted money for the war with France.
Not wishing to apply to Parliament in the usual way, for
fear of a refusal, as Parliament had already made him "rant
after grant, much to the vexation of the people, he tried
what is called a " friendly loan," which means, he said to
the people : "Lend me so much money; if you don't it
will be the worse for you," through his great minister
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 53 -->
Wolsey. Commissioners were sent into every county
to calculate how much each person was to pay, and the
demand was for one-tenth of their income or to provide
soldiers. But this trick failed, so Wolsey was obliged
to apply to Parliament, which granted the levy of
another tax. This failed also, and the commissioners who
came into Kent were driven away, but the king was spared
further anxiety about getting money for the war with
France by the issue of the battle of Pavia, in Italy, 1525,
by which France was for the time crushed.  
  
  
  THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES.


Without troubling you with details about the causes of
that great Reformation which gave us our Bible and
Prayer Book, and freed our country for ever—with the
exception of the short reign of Queen Mary—from the
power of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church, you
should be told that the two chief causes were :—


(1) The spread of knowledge, brought about by the
invention of printing, a movement in which a Kentish
man named Caxton took a great part.


(2) The strong feeling against the power of the Pope
which had been excited by the remonstrance of Martin
Luther against the sale of indulgences in particular—that
is to say, against the practice of selling pardons for any
crimes, no matter how serious, in order that the Pope's
purse might be kept constantly full.


As regards England, one chief cause was the opposition
of the Pope to Henry the Eighth's divorce from his wife
Katharine of Arragon. In 1534 the Act of Supremacy
made Henry the head of the English Church instead of the
Pope. Of course the monks, being Roman Catholics, felt
this change very severely, for it was one thing to be
governed by the Pope, who was hundreds of miles away,
and another to be governed by a king who at any moment
mic'ht pay them a visit and inquire into a mode of life
which would not bear much inspection. Besides, the
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 54 -->
influence of the monks as an independent power was gone.
So the first time the great abbots and priors expressed
their anger at the change of things Henry determined he
would crush them once and for all.


Now*, although with the exception of Canterbury, the
priories and abbeys of Kent could not be compared with
the priories and abbeys of other counties for wealth and
magnificence, there were some which were worth putting
down from the point of view of a king who had an eye
on the treasure he would put into his own pockets.


The priories of Christ Church and St. Augustine's in
Canterbury, for instance, were very rich. So were the
nunnery of St. Sepulchre's, and the priory of St. Gregory
and the houses of the Black Friars, and the Franciscans in
the same city. There was a famous abbey at Boxley,
another at Lesnes near Erith, priories at Dover—a famous
and rich one, St. Martin's—and Folkestone, and Sandwich,
and Langden, and Aylesford; abbeys at St. Radigund's
near Dover, at Faversham, and a house of " Observants"
near Greenwich. At any rate, the priors and abbots and
monks of Kent do not seem to have been at all behind the
rest of the county in their dodges and tricks to get money
out of the people.


In 1531 Elizabeth Barton, of Aldington, near Smeeth,
called " the Holy Nun of Kent," made a great stir which
lasted some years. She was a poor girl and subject to
hysterical fits, wbich sometimes made her fancy she saw
visions and heard heavenly voices, and Masters, the Rector
of Aldington, saw that with a little management this
affliction might be turned to good account, which he meant
might bring in money. So he set to work and trained the
poor girl to believe that she was no ordinary servant
wench, but a specially inspired person. Having taught the
girl her lesson Masters got an image of the Virgin Mary,
and Elizabeth was trained to declare that this image would
cure her fits, and acted in such a way that the simple
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 55 -->
country folk believed it, and the Aldington image became
an object of pilgrimage from all parts of the country.

The great church people of Canterbury thought it a pity
that a small place like Aldington should reap the benefit of
such a capital trick, so the image was removed to the
cathedral city, and Elizabeth Barton was lodged in the
nunnery of St.Sepulchre. Her fame spread over the country,
for she was now taught to pretend to be a prophetess—a
person who can foretell what is going to happen—and some
of the greatest and wisest people in England came to
consult her.


Then she went too far. Not content with teHii*-***
ordinary people what was going to happen to them she, at
the bidding of the Canterbury clergy, who were now in
great fear and trembling about the attack being made on
them by the king, took the part of Queen Katharine, whom
the king wanted to get rid of so that he might marry
Anne Boleyn, and threatened the king that he would lose
his crown and perhaps his life if he persisted in his resolve.


The king laughed at all this, and for three years the
Holy Nun of Kent was believed in by the people and
upheld by the clergy, but in 1534 she and the five monks
who had been her chief teachers were brought to London,
tried and executed at Tyburn.


King Henry did not crush all the monasteries at once.
In 1536 he began with the smaller houses with incomes less
than £200 a year—that is, £2,400 of our money—and put
down three hundred and seventy-six. Two years later he
attacked the greater houses, and at about this time another
piece of Kentish ecclesiastical humbug was exposed. This
was the famous " Rood," or Image of Grace, at Boxley—an
image of the Virgin of which the bod}7 bowed, the forehead
frowned and the lower lip dropped, to the amazement of the
poor simple country people, and no doubt of others who
were not poor and were only simple inasmuch as they were
superstitious, who of course thought that the image did so
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 56 -->
of its own accord, and came by thousands to offer prayers,
and what was more to the point, jewels and money.


This piece of monkish carpentering was taken up to
London, made to go through its performance at Whitehall,
then the machinery which moved the body and forehead
and lips was shown, and the image dashed to pieces.


At this time the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket at
Canterbury was at the height of its popularity. It is said,
for instance, that during the year 1538 there were no
offerings at all at God's altar, only £4 Is. 8d. at the Virgin
Mary's altar; but £954 6s. 3d., or more than £12,000 of our
money, at the altar of St. Thomas.


No wonder that the monks of Canterbury were getting
uneasy about the king's movements !


Well, the first thing that was done was very funny. As
if poor Thomas a Becket was still alive he was ordered to
appear within thirty days and answer to the charge of
treason. As of course he did not appear his bones were
taken from beneath the magnificent shrine and scattered
about; his name was removed from the prayer books as
that of a traitor; all figures of him on the stained glass
windows were destroyed, except those on three windows of
the Trinity Chapel which still remain; the splendid
offerings at the shrine were packed away for the king's use,
and all that is left to remind us of a spot to which the
greatest, and bravest, and best of all nations had come
as pilgrims during four hundred years, is the flight of steps
on the right hand of the choir as you go up to the tomb of
the Black Prince, worn away into hollows by the hundreds
of thousands of pilgrims who used to ascend them on their
knees.


On September 30th, 1538, his bones were shown for the
last time to a party of French ladies; but in 1888 the
skeleton of a big man with a deep wound in his skull was
found beneath the floor of the cathedral crypt, and this has
been decided by recent discoveries to be the skeleton of
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 57 -->
Becket which had been removed and buried by devout
people at the first news that the shrine was going to be
destroyed.


Henry the Eighth made a great many journeys in Kent,
and used to stop at the Archbishop's palaces at Otford,
Leeds, Charing, and Canterbury. In his reign were built
the castles at Sandown, Deal, and Walmer as a defence
against possible French invasion, the first-named of which
was sold the other day for £40 !


He was very fond of Greenwich palace, where, as I have
said, he was born, used to hunt much in the park, and
kept several Christmas festivals with high state. When he
was courting Anne Boleyn, who was living at Hever Castle,
he would ride over from Greenwich, and tradition says when
he reached a certain hill whence he could see the castle,
and which bears his name, blew his horn to give notice of
his approach. I don't know the hill although I have looked
for it. There is a Mount Harry at Sevenoaks; but what a
horn it would be which could be heard from there to Hever
Castle !


Henry was married to Katharine of Arragon at
Greenwich. His youngest sister, the Princess Mary Tudor,
was married to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, in the
church of the Grey Friars there. Anne of Cleves and
Anne Boleyn he married at Greenwich, and the latter
had the park arranged exactly on the plan of her father's
park at Blickling, in Norfolk. On May morning 1515,
Henry and Katharine of Arragon went maying in the
woods about Shooters Hill, and had an open-air festival
there, a description of which may interest you :—


At Shooters Hill the archers of the king's guard met
them dressed like Robin Hood and his outlaws, and begged
that the royal party " would enter the good green wood,
and see how outlaws lived."  
  
  
  On this, Henry, turning to the queen, asked her " If she
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 58 -->
and her damsels would venture into a thicket with so many
outlaws 1 "


Katharine replied, " That where he went she was
content to go."


The king then handed her to a sylvan bower formed of
hawthorn boughs, spring flowers, and moss, where was laid
out a breakfast of venison. The queen partook of the feast
and was greatly delighted with this lodge in the wilderness.
On their way home to Greenwich they were met by a
flowery car, drawn by five horses, each of which was ridden
by a fair damsel. These burst into song when they met
the queen at the foot of Shooters Hill, and preceded them,
singing May carols all the way to Greenwich. (Strickland)  
  
  
  Mary.—1553-1558.


The great Kentish event of this reign was the rebellion
of Sir Thomas Wyatt, of Allington, son of the lover of
Anne Boleyn.


In 1554 the queen's marriage with that poor creature,
Philip of Spain, about whom you read in that most
fascinating " History of the Rise of the Dutch Republic "
by Mr. Motley, was very unpopular in England, for the
people, with a new born dread of Papistry, and especially
of Spanish Papistry, seemed to foresee that the alliance
was the first step towards England becoming one of the
wretched colonies of Spain. Sir Thomas Wyatt raised
Kent, with the exception of Canterbury, where the Sheriff
of Kent and Lord Abergavenny held the people loyal to
Mary, and, gathering troops, pursued a party of the rebels
under Sir Henry Isley and Anthony Knevett, who were on
their way to join Wyatt at Rochester, came up with them
near Wrotham and put them to flight.


In the meanwhile Mary energetically appealed to the
citizens of London, promising them that if the Houses of
Paliament should decide against her marriage with Philip
she would abandon it, and sent a herald to Rochester with
an assurance of pardon for the rebels if they would at once
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 59 -->
disperse. Wyatt's answer was that they needed no pardon,
and the London troops were about to fire on the town
when suddenly they all declared themselves Wyatt's men.
WTith this important addition to his strength Wyatt should
at once have marched on London, but he wasted time in
besieging Cowling Castle and took it. In the meanwhile
Mary appealed again to the Londoners and with such success
that by the time Wyatt reached the Thames he found
Southwark Bridge barred against him. So he marched
down the river bank to Kingston, crossed the river, and
marched back to London by the other bank. By this
time however his followers were disheartened by the loyal
spirit of London which Wyatt had assured them would
declare for him, and they deserted in great numbers, so
that he arrived at Temple Bar with but a few men, was
easily taken prisoner, and executed on Tower Hill.


The town of Maidstone had its freedom taken away for
the part it had taken in this rebellion.


The English people's fears about the Spanish marriage
were partially realised, for Mary was a bigoted Roman
Catholic, or rather, she was blindly devoted to a husband
whose entire aim in life was to stamp out heresy and
kill all who were not Roman Catholics, and what is called
the Marian Persecution began.


During the three years it lasted nearly three hundred
people were burned, and nowhere, except perhaps in Essex,
was the persecution fiercer than in the diocese of Canterbury,
where Richard Thornton, Bishop of Dover, was the
Inquisitor or judge. The most terrible cases were those of
twenty-three men and women who were burned at
Canterbury, five men starved in Canterbury Castle, and
five women and two men burned at Maidstone. The first
female martyr in England was a poor Kentish woman
named Margaret Polley, who was burned at Tonbridge. In
all fifty-six people were executed in Kent during this
persecution.
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 60 -->
  
  Elizabeth.—1558-1603.


Elizabeth was born at Greenwich. She kept her court
at Greenwich, and always celebrated with great pomp our
grand old national festival of St. George, which I am sorry
to say has been allowed to be neglected and forgotten,
as well as many other of the great days of Merrie England.


I don't know of any events of actually historic
importance during this reign particularly associated with
Kent, but I may tell you of some interesting Kentish facts.


During the reign of Elizabeth the Kentish woollen
industry was in full swing. Whilst the Spaniards under
Alva were treating the poor people of the Netherlands
in a manner which makes one's blood boil to read
of, a great many of the persecuted fled to England for
refuge—just as persecuted people from all parts of Europe
always have done, always do, and always will do. A great
many baize and flannel workers settled in >Sandwich, and
started an industry which actually preserved the old
Cinque Port from absolute decay, for the sea had receded
from it, kings and armies no longer used it as a port,
and merchants no longer crowded its streets and quays as
of yore.


Many of these Flemings, too, were expert vegetable and
flower gardeners, and to them we owe not only many
flowers and vegetables, but what we had not before, a
regular scientific system of gardening.


Other Flemings settled at Maidstone and wove linen
thread, and for a long time after they had gone their
peculiar work was known as " Dutch."


In 1561 numbers of Frenchmen, Protestants flying from
the persecutions in their own country, were allowed
to settle in Canterbury, and practised silk weaving.
Formerly they had their looms in the cathedral crypt,
side by side with the chapel which was given them for
worship, and their descendants still worship in the same
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 61 -->
chapel alchough the silk industry has gone from Canterbury
to Spitalfields in London.


They also made " lustreings "—some shiny silken stuff I
suppose, brocades, satins, paduasoys, black and coloured
velvets, watches, cutlery, instruments, hardware, and toys.
The silk for the decoration of the Prince of Wales's
nicagnificent Carlton House was made in 1789 at Canterbury.
In the year 1665 there were one hundred and twenty-six
master weavers and thirteen hundred workmen, of which
seven hundred were English, in Canterbury. In 1676 the
number had risen to two thousand five hundred, and the
brotherhood held a charter of its own.


Kent was also now the centre of the ship building trade
for the Royal Navy, and much of the oak which had
covered the Weald before its clearance w*as used in
building the " wooden walls of Old England."


In Henry the Seventh's reign the "Great Henry" was
built at Chatham at a cost of, it is said, one hundred and
fourteen thousand pounds. In Henry the Eighth's reign
were built at Woolwich the " Regent," of one thousand
tons burden; the "Henry Grace de Dieu," which cost—I
give the figures exactly—" Six thousand, four hundred and
seventy-eight pounds, eight shillings, and three farthings !"
and the " Great Harry."


Some alarm was created in this reign about the
consumption of the trees in the Weald of Sussex for the
iron furnaces, as the Wealden forest supplied almost all the
oak for the ship building of the Royal Navy.


There was never so great an iron industry in Kent as in
Sussex, but during this reign of Elizabeth there were
furnaces at Cranbrook, Hawkhurst, Goudhurst, Horsmonden,
Cowden, Tonbridge, Biddenden,and Ashurst, and in old
farm houses you may still see fire grate backs and kitchen
utensils made of Kentish or Sussex iron, and in one or two
churchyards even slabs of iron over graves.  
  
  
  Moreover, a great many cannon were made and sent
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 62 -->
abroad to nations who might use them against us. Indeed,
I have read somewhere that upon a cannon fished up from
the wreck of one of the Spanish Armada ships off the
coast of Ireland was found the mark of a Sussex
ironfounder.


In the year 1573 Queen Elizabeth made a state
\"Progress " through Kent. It may be interesting to you
to read where she went, and it is amusing to hear what
Lord Burleigh wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury about it:—


\"The queen had a hard beginning of her Progress in the
Wild of Kent... where surely were more dangerous
rocks and valleys and much worse ground than in the
Peak " (of Derbyshire).


She started from Greenwich and reached Croydon, where
she remained seven days at Archbishop Parker's palace—
part of which you may still see. Thence she went to
Orpington—or rather, to Sir Percival Hart's house <at
Lullingstone, where she was entertained with a magnificent
nautical masque or play. Thence she went to Knole at
Sevenoaks, her own palace. Thence to Lord Bergavenny's
{empty}.at Birlingham, and to the same nobleman's castle at Eridge,
where she stayed six days. Thence to the house of the old
Kentish Colepepers at Bedgbury, to Hempstead and to
Rye. Thence to Sissinghurst, belonging to Mr. Baker,
whom she knighted. Then to Boughton Malherbe,
Hothfield, and to her own house at Westenhanger. Then
she went to Dover, and from Dover to Folkestone, where
the knights and gentlemen of Kent gave her a splendid
greeting. From Folkestone she travelled to Canterbury,
where she was lodged at the palace of St. Augustine.
Here she was splendidly entertained for a fortnight by
Archbishop Parker, and celebrated her birthday. Then
she went on to Sandwich, where she had a magnificent
reception. There were banquets and sea sports at Stonar,
and she was so pleased with the cookery at the feast
given her in the Grammar School at Sandwich that she
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 63 -->
allowed the usual rule th.at no food should be offered to a
sovereign unless it had been previously tasted by the official
taster to be broken.


On the last day of her visit to Sandwich a pretty sight
was offered her. On a raised turf bank were seated more
than a hundred English and Dutch children weaving fine
cloth.


She returned to Canterbury, went on to Sittingbourne—
which was then, and until the time of mail coaches, a
regular stopping place of the great folk travelling between
Dover and London—and from Sittingbourne she travelled
to Rochester, where she stayed five days at the Crown Inn.


From Rochester she went to Chatham. Here she stayed
at a house which she desired should always be called Satis
House, meaning that it was all sufficient for her comfort
and entertainment, from the Latin word satis— enough;
and this name is still borne by the house which stands
where the old one did, and of which you may remember to
have read, or one day you will read, in Charles Dickens's
\"Great Expectations." From Chatham she went to
Dartford, and stayed at one of the abbeys which Henry
the Eighth had put down, where Anne of Cleves lived a
great deal. From Dartford she returned to Greenwich.


Of course you must remember that these " Progresses "
were very longaffairs, occupying several weeks—this one,
for instance, lasted ten weeks—for the roads of England
were little better than big cart ruts and were quite useless
in wet weather. Even the greatest and wealthiest people
preferred to travel on horseback or in chairs carried by
men, called " litters," to the risk of being upset and breaking
their bones by travelling in the clumsy carriages of the
period, which were made without straps or springs and
were called "whirlicotes." Queen Elizabeth was carried
about in a " litter " under a canopy during her Progresses.


Our Kent coast men of this period were sad pirates, and
complaints were constantly being made by the Court of
<!-- Leaf 84, Page: 64 -->
Spain—Spaniards were the particular objects of English
horror and hatred—of the daring acts of piracy and pillage
done by Dover and Margate men. Thomas Cobham, of
Cowling Castle, was one of the most reckless of these sea
dogs, and for attacking and sinking in the Bay of Biscay a
Spanish ship, with the treasure of which he made off, he
was tried and the Spaniards were only satisfied when they
were told that he had been sentenced to be taken to the
Tower of London, stripped naked, placed with a sharp
stone under each of his shoulders, and on his stomach a gun
too heavy for him to bear, but not heavy enough to crush
him at once. There he was to be left till he died, with a
few grains of corn to eat and foul water to drink. (Froude)
But this sentence was really never carried out.  
  
  
  THE ARMADA. 1588.


The Armada had been long threatened. In 1586 Kent
was ordered to have in readiness 1,500 men, 9,000 pounds
of powder, 900 pounds of lead, and six cannon, which was
nearly double what was required of any other southern
county. Beacons—iron grates in which fires were lighted
placed at the top of tall posts—were fixed at Goudhurst,
Cranbrook, Hawkhurst, Rolvenden, Tenterden, Coxheath,
Westerham, Ightham, Shooter's Hill, Oak of Honor Hill,
near Sydenham, and even the clergy were trained to the
use of arms should necessity arise.


The Cinque Ports contributed to the English fleet six
ships of one hundred and sixty tons and more each, at a
cost of £43,000 : not much compared with what they used
to do in earlier times, but we must remember that by the
reign of Queen Elizabeth once famous ports such as
Sandwich, Romney, Rye, and Winchelsea, were losing
their old importance because the sea had receded from
them. Moreover, the west country was becoming famous
as a nursery for sailors, so that most of the splendid
exploits of our sailors during this reign were performed by
Devonshire men and Cornishmen.
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 65 -->
  
  But we nmy be quite sure that when  
  
  
  "Eastward straight from wild Blackheath the warlike errand  
  
  
  went,


And roused in many an ancient hall the gallant squires of Kent;"
a ready reply was made by our county men, who were
under the command of Sir Thomas Scott, of Scott's Hall,
near Smeeth.


You must never forget that one of the darling heroes of
English history of this, or of any time, was a Kent man.
This was Sir Philip Sidney, of Penshurst, " who was a
gentleman finished and complete, who trod from his cradle
to his grave amidst incense and flowers, and died in a
dream of glory; " " who," says Lord Brooke, " was a true
model of worth, a man fit for conquest, plantation,
reformation, or what action soever is greatest and hardest
amongst men; withal such a lover of mankind and goodness
that whosoever had real parts in him found comfort,
participation (sympathy), and protection to the uttermost
of his power."


I need not repeat to you the beautiful story of his death;
a story so beautiful that even the priggish pryers of the
present day, ever alert to prove to be false our pet stories
and traditions, have left it alone. And so you may believe
that other pretty story told by Sir Walter Scott in
\"Kenilworth " about another gallant Englishman, Sir
Walter Raleigh, who, although not a Kent man, owed a
good deal of his position to his covering a Kentish puddle
with his cloak.


Most of our fine old Kentish houses, such as Charlton,
Cobham, Knole, and Penshurst, if not actually built in this
reign, are Elizabethan in style, and are associated with the
brilliant festivities of the Elizabethan period.

  CHAPTER VII.  
  
  
  THE STEWARTS.  
  
  
  James I.—1603-1625.


This poor ricketty, slobbering, scholarly Scotsman liked
Greenwich much, and hunted in the park in his
characteristic style—that is, propped and bolstered up on
his horse so that he could not have fallen if he had tried to;
and in Sir Walter Scott's " Fortunes of Nigel " you will
read how he was scared by an adventure with Lord
Glenvarloch. A bad Cobham of the grand old house was
engaged in a couple of plots against James called the Main
and the Bye Plots, at the beginning of this reign; the
Main Plot having for its object the placing of the king's
cousin, Arabella Stewart, on the throne, and the Bye Plot
that of getting hold of the king himself and " improving "
the government. Both failed, however, and Cobham got
off with haying his hetad on the executioner's block—thereby
undergoing the disgrace of being beheaded without being
beheaded. Raleigh was concerned with Cobham in the
first plot, and was also leniently dealt with, but to the
eternal shame of our county man was afterwards executed
upon what is now believed to be the entirely false evidence
of Cobham, whom he described as a " base, dishonourable,
poor soul!"
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 67 -->

At Charlton House lived Henry, Prince of Wales, with
his tutor, Adam Newton. His early death at the age of
eighteen was a great grief, not only to his father, but to the
people generally, for he showed great promise, " would have
proved an heroic and military character. Had he ascended
the throne the days of Agincourt and Cressy had been
revived, and Henry IX. had rivalled Henry V."—so says
Disraeli the elder. Note, ye Kentish boys, that Prince
Henry was a golf player, and the Royal Blackheath Golf
Club was founded in this reign.  
  
  
  Charles L—1625-1649.


I have now come to an interesting period of our Kentish
history—perhaps the most interesting, and moreover
curious as showing how a people, ever to the fore in
asserting, and, when necessary, fighting for their rights,
could yet retain an almost invincible reverence for the
office of king.


In Kent, opinion about the tremendous questions which
were agitating the country from end to end was at first
decidedly on the side of the Parliament, but was changed
later on by what Kent men considered to be a violation of
ancient rights and customs, and by the conviction that the
conquering party was going too far. When the king
played the part of tyrant Kent was against him. When
the army after Naseby threatened to play the same part
Kent rose for the king, and the extraordinary enthusiasm
with which the noblemen and gentlemen and people of
Kent did this only makes the trickery and double
dealing of Charles the more disgusting, and makes
all the grander the chance he threw away. You may
depend upon it that when the gentlemen of Kent turn
against a sovereign he or she must be very bad indeed.

Although my business is really only to tell you about the
history of England so far as it is associated with the history
of Kent I am obliged now and then to go a little out of  
  
  
  F 2
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 68 -->
  
  my way to make the road we are travelling together more

easy.

We have now got to the eve of the great civil war, and

some of you naturally ask, What was the civil war about 1
Well, in a very few words I can tell you. King Charles
intended to govern the country in his own way, and for his
own benefit, without asking or taking the advice of those
people who are placed in high position for the express
purpose of giving this advice. Parliament and the people
of England determined that he should not. Necessary
result—a series of collisions ending in one great one,
called war.


In 1642, after Charles had insulted the whole nation
by attempting to arrest five members of Parliament
whom he imagined to be the chief organisers of the
opposition to him, the freeholders of Kent—by whom
I mean the men who had the right of voting at elections
—marched to London to show their sympathy with
Parliament. Later on, when the king declared war by
setting up his standard at Nottingham, a petition was
presented by the " Lords, Knights, Gentry, and Commons
of Kent " to serve for the Parliament. Now note this :
they desired to serve for the Parliament, not to fight
against and do harm to the king, but " to rescue him out
of the hands of his wicked advisers." Bad as he was, they
would give him every chance, for was he not after all the
\"Lord's anointed 1"


When the war began in earnest Parliament acted
promptly. Dover Castle was secured, suspected royalists—
men of the king's party—were imprisoned, and the houses
of William Boteler and Sir Edward Dering plundered.


At Canterbury arms and powder were found at the
Deanery. The Parliament soldiers broke into the cathedral,
battered down the organ, pulled up the communion rails,
hacked the image of our Lord out of the communion table
embroidery, and made a target of our Lord's statue over
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 69 -->
the south gate. Why 1 Because one of the chief
accusations against the king was that he was planning to
make England Popish, and that he had a great deal to do
with that terrible rebellion of Roman Catholics in Ireland
in which the English had been murdered by thousands,
and which was one of the chief causes of the civil war. The
troops of the Parliament were nearly all Presbyterians, so
that all images and pictures were hateful to them.


In 1643 a Royalist meeting in Kent was put down, but
already the feeling in favour of the king was growing, for
the people of Kent began to see that triumph of the
Parliament and its Presbyterian army might mean a jump
for ordinary folk from the frying pan into the fire. And
so in 1645 Parliamentary recruiting for the army—which,
no doubt, meant the compulsory pressing of men—■
was forcibly resisted in Kent. Five hundred recruits on
their way to London rose upon their guards, seized Sir
Percivall Hart's house at Lullingstone, and stood a regular
siege against two troops of horse and two cannon. At
Christmas, 1647, the Kentish people had a taste of what
the triumph of the army—which was now the supreme
power—meant for them. The king had been utterly beaten
by this New Model Army, as it was called, had fled to his
countrymen, the Scots, who, with characteristic smartness,
kept him as a hostage until the English people should pay
them their claims for services rendered—a prisoner in fact,
for although a hostage does not exactly mean a prisoner,
the Scots knew that to get possession of the king's person
was the great object of Cromwell and his army, and that
they would pay the claims to get him.


Well, Kent was ruled by sour-faced, canting Roundheads,
as they are called—men of the kind who would, as Lord
Macaulay says, stop bull baiting, not because it gave pain
to the bull, but because it gave pleasure to the people; and
the authorities in Canterbury not merely ordered that there
should be none of the customary joviality and festivity at
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 70 -->
Christmas, 1647, but that shops should be openedand a
market held on Christmas Day. Up rose the sturdy
Canterbury men at this. Football was played in the streets,
the Mayor was knocked down. On the 27th the rioting
was serious, and cries of " Up with King Charles ! " and
\"Down with Parliament! " openly raised. Finally, the
Mayor and magistrates who had given the unpopular orders
were driven out of the city and the gates barred against
them. Quiet was only restored by the arrival of the
trained bands—answering to our Militia—who broke
through the walls and unhinged the gates.


In January, 1648, the Grand Jury of Kent refused to
receive the complaint against the rioters made by the
authorities, and sent up to Cromwejl the same petition
which had already been made by Surrey and Essex—that
an arrangement should be made with the king, that the
bullying army should be disbanded, and that the known
laws of the land should be restored.


This petition was forbidden to be sent by the County
Committee, which was of course composed of men of the
victorious party, and so the feeling of Kent towards them
became one of absolute hatred, which in the year 1648
broke out in that fierce rebellion called " The Kentish
Faire."


To understand this properly we must look back for a
minute at the state of affairs. King Charles was a prisoner
in Carisbrooke Castle, Isle of Wight. The Scots had
delivered him up to the army upon payment of their claim
of £400,000 for services rendered. He was taken to
Hampton Court, where he lived to all appearance as a free
man. Here he plotted to escape, and arranged for a
Royalist rising in Scotland so that the terrible army under
Fairfax would be obliged to go north, when he hoped the
Londoners, glad to get rid of their stern masters, would
declare and rise for him.  
  
  
  But the Scots delayed their movements, and in the
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 71 -->
meanwhile the last spurts of Royalist resistance were beino*
stamped out in the West of England. Charles made an
attempt to escape from the castle, but it was prevented, and
he was more sharply looked after.


Then Kent petitioned for the " arrangement" with the
king, as had Surrey aiid Essex, saying " Kent will be loyal
to her king should all the rest of the kingdom prove
wicked."  
  
  
  Here is a Kentish song of the day :—
\"Kentish men, keep your king,  
  
  
  
Long swords and brave hearts bring;
Down with the rebels, and slit their crop ears !  
  
  
  Hell now is wanting rogues,  
  
  
  
Send there the canting dogs,
Ride to the scurry, my Kent cavaliers  
  
  
  God and our king for grace,  
  
  
  
Leave now your wives' embrace,
Up and avenge all their insults for years !

Ironsides ! Who's afear ?  
  
  
  Pack 'em to Lucifer,  
  
  
  Ride to the scurry, my Kent cavaliers !


Can't you imagine this being roared out by half-a-dozen
handsome, reckless, flushed young fellows round the
flagondecked table of one of our ancient halls of Kent 1 I can;
and although I'm not on the side of King Charles, I can't
help a thrill of enthusiasm when I try to picture the scene,
and a pang of sorrow that so utterly unworthy a man could
inspire such splendid enthusiasm.


Here's a verse of another Kentish cavalier song, by
Robert Browning. Is not the swing of the chorus grand 1  
  
  
  Marching Along.  
  
  
  " Kentish Sir Byng stood for his king,

Bidding the crop-headed Parliament swing;

And, pressing a troop unable to stoop

And see the rogues flourish and honest folk droop,  
  
  
  Marched them along,
Fifty score strong,  
  
  
  Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song !
Chorus—Fifty score strong ! Fifty score strong !  
  
  
  Great-hearted gentlemen singing this song ! "
<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 72 -->

I could give you a lot of others, but we must get on
with the Faire.


The Kent men began by sweeping all the Roundhead
authorities from the north and east and sea-board—Rochester,
Sittingbourne, Faversham, and Sandwich were taken. At
Rochester there was a great meeting, and the county
gentlemen agreed to lead the work and a county gathering
on Blackheath arranged. Then Dartford and Deptford
were seized. The fleet stood for the king. Sandown and
Walmer Castles were taken, but Deal was successfully
defended by Colonel Rich against the Royalists, and Dover
was besieged.


I like to record the names of the Kentish gentlemen
concerned with those stirring times. Lord Goring was the
commander-in-chief; Mr. Edward Hales was general; Sir
John Many, major-general; Sir Thomas Peyton,
lieutenantgeneral; and other officers were Sir Robert Tracy, Sir John
Dorell, Sir Richard Hardres, Colonel Washington, Colonel
L'Estrange; and, of course, a Colepeper. Their watchword
was " King and Kent! "  
  
  
  On Blackheath Essex men joined the Kent men.


Fairfax, the Parliamentary general, who had jointly with
Cromwell won the battle of Naseby, came out from London,
and at the news of his approach the Kent men retired to
Dartford. Fairfax occupied Blackheath, and marched with
eight thousand men by Eltham towards Rochester—the
main road by Dartford being occupied by the Royalists.
Finding Rochester barred against him Fairfax went round
by Mailing to Meopham and halted.


Meanwhile other Kent men assembled on Penenden
Heath, seven thousand in number. The Earl of Holland
was elected commander, and the Earl of Norwich as leader
—a worse man for the place could not have been
chosen. This was at noon on June 1st, 1648. At five
o'clock in the afternoon Fairfax's regiment was seen
\"through perspective glasses " on the west side of the
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 73 -->
Medway. One thousand Kent men were posted to guard
the river at Aylesford, and three thousand were placed in
Maidstone.


Fairfax turned south, crossed the Medway at Farleigh
Bridge, crossed Banning Heath, whence he could see
Norwich's Kent men all about Kits Coty House, went
down the road by Barming Rectory, and so turned the
Royalists left—that means, got round on to their left side,
which would force them to make a corresponding change of
position.


The Royalists had thrown up a barricade—a wall made
of anything handy—stones, earth, casks, and even carts—
where the Tovil brook runs into the Medway, and there
was a fight in which the Roundheads won. Another bridge
over the Len was bravely defended, but by seven o'clock
Fairfax was before Maidstone.


Near Farleigh Bridge is the Postling field, which is
pointed out as the burial place of those who fell in the
fight at the bridge.


Then the fighting began in real earnest—the Kent men,
probably not very well armed, and certainly not very well
drilled and disciplined, against that infantry which was to,
as Macaulay says, " drive before it in headlong rout the
finest infantry of Spain, and force a passage into a
counterscarp (fortification) which had just been pronounced
impregnable by the ablest of the Marshals of France."


But the Royalists were driven into the town, and the
fighting which followed was afterwards described by a
Parliamentary soldier who had gone all through the civil
war as the hardest he had ever done. There were
barricades to be taken. Every house along Stone Street
and up St. Gabriel's Hill was occupied and fired from.
There was an earthwork at the top of Stone Street, and at
the top of St. Gabriel's Hill there was a battery of cannon.


But the iron discipline of the New Model Army prevailed
and Maidstone was won, with thirteen hundred prisoners,
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 74 -->
  
  five hundred horse, three thousand arms, nine flags and

eight cannon.

All this time the Earl of Norwich and his men did

nothing but remain about the Aylesford hills, and when
he heard that Maidstone was taken he just rode back to
Rochester.


Fairfax seems to have treated Maidstone leniently, for
he allowed the Kent men to disperse without carrying out
the executions and plundering which generally followed the
capture of a town in these days.


The Earl of Norwich and his men went on from
Rochester to London, expecting the people there to side
with them, and reached Blackheath, pursued by the
Parliamentary officer Whalley.


But the Londoners showed no sympathy; so, thinking
that the county of Essex would be more loyal, Norwich
went on alone to Colchester, leaving his Kentish followers.
These poor fellows, unaccustomed to be far away from
home, felt the same objection to cross the Thames and fight
in an unknown county that the brave Cornish men during
this same civil war felt to crossing the river Tamar, which
divides their county from Devonshire, began to get
homesick, thought that they were deserted by their leader, and
about five hundred of them fled into Surrey.


From this point the operations were carried on in Essex,
and the end of the " Kentish Faire" soon came. Dover
Castle, which was still being besieged, was relieved.
Canterbury surrendered to Ireton, and the Castles of
Sandown and Walmer were blockaded—that is, cut off from
the outer world so as to be starved into submission.


Parliament thought so highly of the victory that a
thanksgiving service was ordered in all the churches of
London and Westminster.


It may be interesting to you to know that during these
troublous times people found leisure to attend to the
punishment of " witches."
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 75 -->

What is a witch ? Well, a witch was always believed to
be an old woman possessed of all sorts of magical powers,
such as the causing of good or bad luck, the punishment of
people who offended her, the telling of fortunes, and the
curing of diseases. Many people, not children or fools,
really thought that witches rode through the air on broom
sticks on stormy nights; and many people at this present
day, fools, but not children, believe that poor harmless old
women who live by themselves, and who pretend to know
more than other folk, are witches.


At any rate, in 1645, Joane Williford, Joan Cariden, and
Jane Hott were executed at Faversham for witchcraft; and
in 1652 five Cranbrook women and one Lenham woman
were hung " for the devilish crime, having bewitched nine
children, one man, and one woman, caused the loss of £500
worth of cattle, and much corn at sea."


You may be interested to know that the sentence of death
on Charles was read by a Kent man, Broughton, of
Maidstone, who was Clerk of the Court, and that the king's
body was embalmed by a Maidstone doctor.  
  
  
  Charles IL —1660-1685.


The southern part of England went well-nigh mad over
the restoration of Charles the Second. Englishmen had
always been a jovial, holiday-loving, ballad-singing,
bellringing people, and they were heartily sick of the stern,
morose rule of the Puritans, who regarded merry-making
as a crime, and refused to believe that happiness and
godliness could exist together.


You can read in Sir Walter Scott's " Woodstock " a far
better description of the splendid pageant which greeted
King Charles on Blackheath, as he passed on his triumphal
progress from Dover to London, than any other that I
know of, and also how the gallant old cavalier, Sir Henry
Lee, was spared just long enough to kiss his sovereign's
hand.
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 76 -->

But this outbreak of jollification was nearly the ruin of
our country, for amidst the enjoyment of pleasures from
which they had been so long held the rulers of the land
forgot their duties. Our navy was rotten and badly
officered, and it was a common thing for a man to command
a troop of horse one week and a frigate the next.


So the Dutch beat us at sea, and swept up the Medway,
destroying ships as they went, and were only prevented
from sailing right up to London by the gallant defence of
Upnor Castle, near Rochester, which beat off six Dutch
men-of-war and five fire ships so that they had to retreat
to the Channel.


Never in our history, before or after, have we sunk so
low as an European power as during this reign, and
perhaps the most disgraceful business of all was the Treaty
of Dover, signed in 1670 between Charles and the French
king, Louis the Fourteenth, by which Charles engaged to
profess publicly the Roman Catholic religion and to assist
Louis in conquering the brave Dutch, whilst Louis agreed
to help Charles with an army should any insurrection
break out in England.  
  
  
  James IL—1685-1688.


James was married to Mary of Modena at Dover, and
made his entry into London by the famous old Canterbury
and Rochester road.


Three years later he was in the neighbourhood of the
same road under very different circumstances—on the
occasion of his flight to Faversham, intending to get to
France, when the news that William, Prince of Orange,
grandson of Charles the First, had landed and was marching
on London to protect the liberties of the English people.


He was recognised at Faversham, accompanied by Sir
Edward Hales—a Kentish gentleman who was exceedingly
unpopular on account of the part played by him and his
patron the king in a case wherein the laws of the land had
been coolly set aside in his favour—and both of them would
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 77 -->
have been handled roughly by the crowd had not the
gentlemen of the neighbourhood formed a body guard
for them.


So saturated were the people with a feeling of loyalty to
the person of the sovereign, even after the last two
abominable reigns, that a Kentish peasant was found ready
and willing to take a message from James to the Council
telling them of his plight. For a time James was forgiven,
and receivedalmost a hearty welcome from the people on
his road to London. But it could not last. He was
obstinate, and mistook this show of feeling for leave to
keep on in his old course of bad government, to set aside
the laws of the country, and to irritate the people by his
Popish prejudices. William of Orange was in power,
and James, seeing that his game was played, retired to
Rochester, where he lived at the house of Sir William
Head. Here he was warned that he had best take his chance
and escape, for the nation was against him and his father's
head had been cut off for no worse behaviour than his, so
he got a boat and went, and a very good riddance he
was.


The Kentish cloth trade began to decay very much under
the last Stewarts. This was wrongly attributed to the
destruction of timber for the iron manufacture, but in
reality it was owing to Acts of Parliament which prohibited
the sending abroad of undyed or white cloth (which was
followed by the emigration of two or three Kentish cloth
workers to the continent), and by the high custom house
duties levied by the Dutch upon all cloth brought into
their country.  
  
  
  William III.—1689-1702.


In 1696 what was known as Fenwick's plot was
discovered. The object of this plot was to attack the king
and kill him as he went to hunt in Richmond Park. The
plot was arranged at Hurst, near Lympne, but was
betrayed. Fenwick fled. " The bells of all the parish
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 78 -->
churches of Romney Marsh rang the alarm; the country
was up; every path was guarded; every thicket was
beaten; every hut was searched, and at length the fugitive
was found in bed." (Macaulay) He was beheaded on
Tower Hill.


In the last year of this reign, 1701, was presented to the
House of Commons the " Kentish Petition," which asserted
that the Commons would do more good by turning their
addresses to the king into bills of supply—which meant
that public business should be attended to before anything
else. This was considered treasonable and impertinent, and
the gentlemen who presented the petition—Champneys, of
Westenhanger; Colepeper, of Preston Hall, Aylesford;
Colepeper, of Hollingbourne; Hamilton of Chelston; and
Polhill, of Chipstead—were imprisoned until Parliament
had finished sitting for the session.

  CHAPTER VIII.  
  
  
  THE BRUNSWICKS.  
  
  
  George IL—1727-1760.


You see I have skipped the reigns of Anne and George
the First, and the reason for this is that the history of
Kent is becoming more and more mixed with the history of
England. So from now we shall hear very little of Kent
playing a separate part in public affairs, and I shall just
pick out such bits about our county as I think will
interest you.


One fact, however, is always to be remembered, that no
matter how much the individuality of Kent fades, she
always remains, and will remain, the bulwark of England
against foreign invasion.  
  
  
  Norfolk men have a rhyme :  
  
  
  " He who would old England win

Must at Weyboume Hope begin;

because the deep water close to the shore at Weybourne
makes the landing of troops easy, but I think we may be
sure that should we ever be threatened by a foreign invasion
Kent would be the first object of attack, just as it was to
Romans, Saxons, Danes, Normans, Frenchmen, and
Dutchmen. So Kent must always be ready. I read in the
\"Gentleman's Magazine" for 1745—the year when Charles
Stewart, the grandson of James the Second, called " The
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 80 -->
Young Pretender," made his romantic attempt to get the
crown of England, that Admiral Vernon sent a warning to
the governor of De.al Castle to be ready for an invasion by
Irishmen from France on behalf of the Pretender.
Thereupon the Deputy Lieutenant of Kent issued a proclamation
calling upon all men to assemble the next day at Swinfield
Minnis or Heath, near Dover (the same place where, you
remember, King John gave up his crown to the Pope's
messenger). All parishes within twenty miles of the sea
coast were to send well armed men, and those men living
near the heath to bring pickaxes, shovels, etc. So well did
the people respond that at the appointed time there were
two thousand well-armed menassembled.  
  
  
  George III.—1760-1820.


In 1794 Wilberforce brought before the House of
Commons his proposal for the Abolition of the iSlave Trade.
He was encouraged to do this " after a conversation with
Mr. Pitt in the open air at the foot of an old tree at
Holwood, just above the steep descent into the Vale of
Keston "—so you may read on the back of the stone seat
close to the old tree, which, I am glad to see, has at last
been railed round and protected from picnickers and
climbing boys.


There was an alarm of invasion in 1778 from the French,
who were actively backing up the colonists of North
America in their glorious battle against tyranny. A great
review was held at Coxheath, between Maidstone and
Marden, which was the Aldershot of those days. The king
was present, and lodged at Leeds Castle, his host, strange
to say, being a descendant of the Parliamentary General
Fairfax who had done so much to bring Charles the First to
the scaffold.


In 1803 England was agitated from end to end by the
news that Bonaparte was coming over with an army.
Nowhere was there greater excitement than in Kent,
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 81 -->
which, as I said before, was still the bulwark of the
country. Read Wordsworth's sonnet to the men of Kent
if you think I am given to brag unduly about the old county.
Volunteers were enlisted in every town and village, and in
a very short time England had an army of three hundred
and eighty thousand men ready for the Frenchmen, in
addition to the regular army—not bad when you remember
that the entire population of England, Wales and Scotland
was only ten millions and a half.


Camps were formed at Coxheath, Chatham, Barham
Downs, Dover, and Shorncliffe. The military canal was
dug from Hythe to Appledore, by which not only could
troops, provisions, and ammunition be moved from place to
place, but in case of dire necessity the whole country about
could be flooded. The Martello towers, with which you
are familiar, were built, their name being taken from a
tower in Corsica called Mortella, which in 1794, garrisoned
by only thirty-eight men, was splendidly defend ed against a
combined land and sea attack by Lord Hood and
MajorGeneral Dundas. (Brewer's Phrase and Fable)


I wish I could give you the numbers for Kent. Our
sea fencibles, however, consisting of fishermen and coast
men, had three districts—from Dungeness to Sandgate, of
which New Romney was the assembly place; from Sandgate
to Sandown, with Dover as centre; and from Sandown to
the North Foreland, with Ramsgate as centre. They were
under county captains and commanders, and numbered
nineteen thousand men, of whom the monthly cost was
seven thousand one hundred pounds. They only had one
chance of showing the stuff they were made of. That was
when a French privateer attacked two brigs off the North
Foreland, and out went forty or fifty of the fencibles, beat
off the Frenchmen, and rescued the brigs.


Privateering—that is, the fitting out of armed vessels by
private individuals for the purpose of capturing or
destroying the merchant vessels of a power at war with us  
  
  
  G
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 82 -->
—w.as in full swing at the beginning of this century. The
\"Catharine and Mary " was a famous Deal privateer. >She
cost only £1,600, and in three months she captured prizes
worth £60,000, but she was at last knocked to bits, and
her captain and crew made prisoners after a terrible fight
with a Frenchman.


There were thousands of French prisoners in England at
this time. Some were confined in the hulks in the Medway,
and theirs was a pitiable fate—imprisoned in crowded,
pestilential quarters, badly fed, and brutally treated by
their guards. Others were shut up in Sissinghurst Castle.
They were handy, ingenious fellows, and made a little
money by selling straw hats, articles made out of the bones
from their meals, pictures in coloured feathers, curiosities,
such as fully-rigged ships in bottles, inlaid wood and so
forth. Smuggling, too, was carried on to a large extent along
the Kentish coast, especially by Romney M.arsh. Hawkhurst
was a great centre; so was Hythe, in the main street of
which you may see a lookout on the roof of a house which
is said to have been used by the smugglers. The only enemy
of the smuggler was the Government. We were at war
with France, but the smuggling luggers ran between the
two coasts just as usual. The vaults and belfries of
churches, and the cellars of halls and manor houses were
used as storage places by the smugglers, for parsons and
country gentlemen were glad enough to give up storage
room in return for good tobacco, tea, spirits and lace, for
which they would have to pay dearly in a shop.


Still, the smugglers got bitten very severely sometimes.
In September, 1773, French silks and lace to the value of
£15,000 were seized by the revenue people and the
dragoons in a house at Hawkinge, near Hythe. In the
same year the officers met a party of smugglers with thirty
horses laden with tea, silk and lace at Dartford. There
was a fight, but the stuff was captured.
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 83 -->

Deal was a great smuggling place, and in 1784 Mr. Pitt,
the Prime Minister, was persuaded into doing rather a
brutal and unnecessary thing in order to check the practice.
A regiment of soldiers was brought to Deal on the day
after a storm when all the smuggling luggers were drawn
high and dry upon the beach, and with loaded muskets
kept back the crowd whilst every boat was burned. I
almost wonder that the Deal people cheered Mr. Pitt as
they did twenty years later when he held a review of the
Deal luggers which had been armed and fitted up as fighting
vessels against the French.


Radford's gang infested the country about Goudhurst
and are believed to be the originals of the chief characters
in G. P. R. James's " Smugglers," which, of course, you have
read. But the most famous gang was the Hawkhurst gang
who flourished about 1747, and who simply defied the
authorities. They were so famous that they were hired by
the Dorsetshire smugglers to make a daring attack upon
the Custom House at Poole, from which they took two
tons of tea and 39 casks of spirits, and murdered two men
whom they suspected to be informers, for which seven
of them were executed at Chichester. They afterwards had
a regular fight with a body of law-abiding people who called
themselves the " Goudhurst Band of Militia " and were
beaten. When captured their captain, Kingsmill, and
half-a-dozen others were executed.


If the smugglers had stuck to their calling people would
not have been so bitter against them, but they were also
highwaymen and housebreakers.  
  
  
  In the " Gentleman's Magazine " for 1745 I read :—


\"At Folkestone a body of smugglers enter'd the house
of Mr. Jordan, a custom house officer, arm'd with carbines
and pistols, destroy'd his goods, and carry'd off his plate,
but one of them, who had ruffles, was shot dead."


\"At an ale-house at Grinsted Green, Kent (Greenstreet
Green, near Farnborough ?) a gang of twelve or fourteen  
  
  
  g 2
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 84 -->
smugglers assaulted three custom house officers, wounded
them in a barbarous manner and robb'd them of their
watches, money and other things of value."


\"Some smugglers enter'd the house of a farmer near
Sheerness and plunder'd it of 1,500 pounds of wool."


I could tell you a lot more stories about Kentish
smuggling, but I have not the space. However, you
should know why men smuggled. In those days there
were heavy duties upon all foreign wine, spirits,
lace and tobacco, and especially on tea until 1784,
when windows were taxed instead. Every man who sold
tea or coffee was bound to have the fact painted over his
door under a penalty of £200; sellers of spirits had to do
the same under a penalty of £50; all Lace goods had to
bear the Government stamp as a proof that duty had been
paid upon them, and imitation of this stamp was punished
by a fine of £200. So with tobacco. Hence the prices of
these goods were so heavy that men who could smuggle
them into the country and sell them at a fair price made
money very quickly. At the end of the last century tea
was twelve shillings a pound—and this after much of the
duty had been taken off and put upon windows. So
that when old ladies went out to tea it was always
understood that they should bring their own tea with
them.


The iron industry of our neighbour, Sussex, was very
active during the reign of George the Third. In Kent
there was only one famous furnace. This was at
Lamberhurst, and was called the " Gloucester." Here, it is
not generally known, were cast the splendid iron railings
round St. Paul's Cathedral, at the cost of sixpence a pound,
the total cost being £11,200. There were also foundries
at Horsmonden and Hawkhurst. A memory of the former
still lingers in the name of the Gun Inn. The foundry at
the latter place belonged to John Penn, the great Quaker,
so that it was pretty old. There was also a gun factory at
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 85 -->
Barden, near Speldhurst. But by the end of the century
this industry had almost entirely left Kent and Sussex for
the north, where coal was abundant and iron, of course,
could be made at much less cost than the destruction of
forests. In 1796 there were one hundred and four furnaces
in England, none in Kent, and only one in Sussex—the
Ashburnham, which kept on until 1825.  
  
  
  George IV—1820-1830.


•So late as 1828 Penenden Heath was regarded as the
natural place of public assembly for Kentishmen. Llere
were held great meetings about the Catholic Emancipation
Act—that is, an Act of Parliament by which for the first
time in Protestant English history Roman Catholics were
to be placed on exactly the same footing as Protestants; and
also upon the great question of the reform of the system of
electing members to Parliament. Here, too, originated the
phrase " Kentish Fire," as applied to vigorous hand
clapping.


The meeting of 1828 was to petition Parliament that
\"the Protestant Constitution of the United Kingdom
might be preserved entire and inviolate "—which meant
that Kent men had not yet learned to regard Roman
Catholics as fit to be trusted. The petition was carried by
a large majority of the, so it is said, 60,000 people present.  
  
  
  William IV—1830-1837.


During this reign the great Reform Bill of 1832 was
passed. As regards Kent, we may note that Hythe, a
town of 2,300 inhabitants, which had until now returned
two members to Parliament, was only allowed to send one;
and that Queenborough, with 800 inhabitants, and New
Romney, which had dwindled to a town of 850 people,
were no longer allowed to send members to Parliament.

Did you ever hear of the Battle of Bosenden ? No ?
Well, the Battle of Bosenden may be considered the last
<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 86 -->
battle fought upon English ground. It w.as in 1832, in
the early days of the Reform Bill, that there came a visitor
to Canterbury with long, flowing hair, armed with sword
and pistols, who called himself Sir William Courtenay,
Knight of Malta. He tried to get into Parliament, but
although several very influential people voted for him, he
failed. We next hear of him tried for perjury—that is,
for breaking his solemn oath as a witness in a court of
justice. He was committed to Maidstone gaol, but as it
was clear that he was not quite right in his mind he was
changed to Banning Asylum, where he remained four

years.


Released from Banning he started his career as a
reformer, promised the rustics all sorts of things, and
became quite popular amongst them. Then he became a
prophet and a religious teacher, and succeeded so well that
by degrees he gathered round him a devoted band of
followers who believed all the rubbish he taught, and were
ready to go anywhere and do anything for him. He then
occupied Bosenden farm.


On May 27th, 1838, Courtenay preached a fiery sermon
before a large congregation on Boughton Hill, and
afterwards led processions through the surrounding villages
with a loaf of bread on a pole as his standard—the idea of
which was that the people were being robbed and starved,
and that it was his mission to save them.


The magistrates now thought it was time to interfere
and issued a warrant for his arrest as a disturber of the
public peace, and a constable named Mears was sent to
Boughton farm to take him into custody. Courtenay saw*
Mears coming and shot him. Thereupon a regular war was
declared between his followers and the authorities, and he
encamped in Bosenden woods. Matters had become
serious, so a hundred soldiers were sent from Canterbury
in command of Lieutenant Bennett. Courtenay was ready
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 87 -->
for them with about a hundred followers armed with
sticks, forks, scythes, and so forth.


Lieutenant Bennett stepped forward and summoned
Courtenay to surrender. Courtenay shot him. The soldiers
fired and killed Courtenay. Then Courtenay's men attacked
the soldiers furiously, and there was a long, fierce struggle,
which lasted from twelve till seven o'clock. The end of it
was that eight of Courtenay's men were killed and seven
wounded, whilst the soldiers had two men killed and six
wounded—a total of ten men killed and thirteen wounded
—not a long list for a battle, and yet, it may surprise you
to hear, longer than the list of many of the pitched battles
between the great captains of the Middle Ages.


Courtenay was really a Cornish man named Thom, from
Truro.


With the Battle of Bosenden I close my little history of
Kent. I might have said a great deal more about almost
every period, but that more you can read for yourselves in
bigger and more learned books than mine, and I only
intend what I have written to help you as a sort of
stepping stone to what others have written more lengthily
and more learnedly. If, after having read or having had read
to you this book you feel a longing to know more about
our grand old county, if it thrills you with a pride which,
from no fault of yours, you have never felt before, then my
aim will have been accomplished.

  APPENDIX.  
  
  
  A—ROYAL KENT.


To support my claim that Kent should be considered the Royal
County of England I subjoin a list—not at all complete, but
sufficiently so for my purposes—of Kentish places associated with
Royalty.

I am quite willing to cut it out of any future edition if anybody
can give me as long and varied a list of associations of Royalty
with any other English county, except, of course, Middlesex.

At Greenwich there was probably a palace of Edward the First.
At any rate, Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, fourth son of King
Henry the Fourth, built a palace here which he called Placentia, or
the Pleasaunce.  
  
  
  Edward IV. enlarged and improved it.
Henry VII. kept his court here and the Christmas of 1492.
Henry VIII. was born here and favoured it much. He married

Katharine of Arragon, Anne Boleyn, and Anne of Cleves here. His
youngest sister, Princess Mary Tudor, was married to Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, in Greenwich.

Elizabeth—Born at Greenwich. Went " Maying in the green
glades at Lewisham." (Perhaps it was on this occasion that,
passing very early through Lewisham before the people were up,
she is said to have called it "long, lazy, lowsy Lewisham.")

Entertained the lady ambassadress from France here. Bade
farewell to her naval heroes here. As Frobisher's squadron of three
vessels, the united tonnage of which was under seventy, passed the
palace on their way to discover the North-West Passage the queen
bade them farewell by waving her hand out of a window.

It was at Greenwich that happened the episode of Raleigh's
cloak.  
  
  
  Edward VI. was born and died here.  
  
  
  Mary was born here.


James I. was very fond of Greenwich, and hunted much in its
park after his fashion.

Charles II. pulled down the old " Placentia " and began a new
one, but had no money to go on with it.

Mary, wife of William of Orange, was received at Greenwich
Palace. She founded the hospital, but did not endow it—that is,
provide it with money. She kept Charles the Second's unfinished
wing as a reception place for foreigners of distinction.

Miss Strickland in her " Lives of the Queens of England " says
that the navy of England declined miserably for fifty years after
the sovereigns ceased to live at Greenwich Palace.
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 89 -->
  
  ELTHAM.


Possibly the Anglo-Saxon kings had a palace here.

Henry III. kept Christmas here, 1'270, and this is the first we
hear about it after the fighting Bishop Beck of Durham built it.

Edwaed III. held parliaments here, and entertained here after
the battle of Poictiers his prisoner, King John of France.

Richard II. liked Eltham much and entertained here royally.

Henry IV. kept Christmas, 1405, here.

Henry' VI. lived here.


Edward IV. built the parts now standing—the hall and the
bridge.

Henry VII. preferred Greenwich, but his children were educated
here.  
  
  
  Henry* VIII. kept two Christmases here.
Elizabeth used to come here as a child.


James I. was the last sovereign who visited Eltham. This was
in 1612.


(For most of the foregoing particulars I am indebted to Black's
Guide Book to Kent).  
  
  
  blackheath.


We may safely say that every one of our kings and queens has
passed over Blackheath on the way to or from Dover, as well as
every foreign sovereign or person of distinction who has visited our
land up to the mail coach era.

Henry V. was greeted here on his return home from Agincourt
in 1415 by the Lord Mayor and citizens of London.

It was on Blackheath that Henry VIII. had the first sight of
Anne of Cleves, and a very magnificent affair the ceremony was.
You ma}' read a full account of it in Miss Strickland's " Lives of the
Queens of England,'' under "Anne of Cleves."

On Blackheath Charles II. was greeted on his restoration.  
  
  
  c.vnterbcry


Was, as I have told you, the residence of the Kings of Kent
from verv early times, but to make up for its ancient popularity
with our" rulers, until this present year of grace, 1894, no royal
personage had entered the city for more than fifty years.

Henry I. kept his court here.

Richard I. received here the homage of William, King of
Scotland.


John kept the Christmas of 1204 here.

Henry III. married Eleanor of Provence here and kept the
Christmas of 1263.

Edward I. was married here to Margaret of France, 1299.

Edward the Black Prince was married to the Fair Maid of
Kent here, and was buried here. _

Henry IV. and his queen, Joanne of Navarre, were buried here.

Henry of Richmond, afterwards Henry VIL, married Elizabeth
of York here. _

Henry VIII. was entertained here with Charles V. ot Spain.

{empty}A.n*ne" or Cleves was met here on her road from the coast by the
Archbishop and many gentlemen and lodged at St. Augustine's.
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 90 -->

Elizabeth kept her court here 1573, during the Progress of
which I have spoken, and coquettishly accompanied her suitor, the
Duke of Anjou, as far when he was returning to France.

Charles I. was married to Henrietta Maria here.


Charles II. stayed here three nights on his restoration.

Mary, the wife of William of Orange, accompanied her husband
to the coast on his way to Holland on one occasion. She arrived
unexpectedly at Canterbury on her return journey and wanted the
use of the largest house. This belonged to a lady who didn't like
her, and who, to avoid unpleasantness, locked up her house and
went away. The next largest house was the Deanery, and Mary
got there before even fires could be lighted. But Dean Hooper
treated the queen so well that she, having noticed how shabby and
dirty the cathedral altar hangings were, presented a fringed
velvet, flowered with silver, valued at £500.

Amongst royal visitors to the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket were
Henry II., Henry III., Edward I., the queen of Edward II.,
Richard I., Richard II., Henry V.; Manuel, Emperor of the East;
Sigismund, Emperor of the West—that is, of the eastern and
western divisions of the Roman Empire, about 1216; Henry VIII.
and Charles V. of Spain.


Sandwich and Margate were favourite ports whence our sovereigns
embarked for and landed from the continent. Our armies and navies
almost always departed from Kentish ports before Portsmouth
and Plymouth attained importance. The Pvoyal list of Dover is, of
course, a long one, and the towns on the road to London—
Sittingbourne ami Rochester—were regular halting places of great
people. It was the rule for distinguished travellers to furbish
themselves up a bit before they made their final entry into the
capital, and this they seem to have performed at an inn standing
on the site of the present Bricklayers' Arms in the Old Kent Road.
At any rate, a framed placard in the bar of the modern publicdiouse
sets forth a goodly list of distinguished visitors.  
  
  
  B.—THE CINQUE PORTS.


Although the name was used soon after the Norman Conquest
it first appears in general use in the reign of John. The
original Cinque Ports were Dover, Hythe, Romney, Sandwich, and
Hastings. To these were added in 1220, in the reign of Henry III.,
two " nobiliora membra"—chief "limbs"—Winchelsea and Rye.
Hence the old rhyme :  
  
  
  "Has. Dov. Sea. Hv.
Sand. Rum. Win. Rye."


Each of these five ports had " limbs " thus :—

The limbs of Hastings were Pevensey, Seaford, Bulverhithe,
Bekesbourne and Grange, near Gillingham.

The limbs of New Romney were Broomhill, Lydd, Old Romney,
Dengemarsh and Oswardstone, near Lydd.

The limb of Hythe was West Hythe.
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 91 -->

The limbs of Dover were Folkestone, Faversham, Margate, St.
John's, Goresend, Woodchurch, St. Peter's, Kingsdown and
Ringwould.

The limbs of Sandwich were Fordwich (then a town, with its
mayor, jurats, and freemen), Deal, Waliner, Ramsgate, Sarre,
Stonar and Brightlingsea in Essex.

The limb of Rye was Tenterden.

Even in 1893 Brightlingsea in Essex was reminded by the election
at Sandwich of a deputy that it was still a limb of Sandwich. This
connection has existed since the reign of Henry VII., Brightlingsea
being bound to pay £5 and an annual contribution of ten shillings
to the support of the Cinque Ports navy.

Yarmouth, too, was connected with the Cinque Ports, and during
the great herring fair which lasted from Michaelmas to Martinmas
the Cinque Ports used to send their bailiffs to keep order, and these
men, behaving in an overbearing and interfering manner, created
an ill feeling between Yarmouth and the Cinque Ports which
actually resulted more than once in fights at sea, during one of
which twenty-five ships were burned.

So long ago as the days of Edward the Confessor the Cinque
Ports had their special privileges which William the Conqueror,
and later, Charles the Second, confirmed.

These privileges were :

Men of Kent entrusted with the coast defence were only taxed
one-third of the amount demanded from people living in the inland


They sent burgesses to Parliament, called barons. A word used
in this case as meaning " free men "—" burgesses."

It is the ri<dit of the Cinque Ports barons to hold the canopy over
kings and queens at their coronation. This rule has only been
broken once—at the coronation of James the First, when the canopy
was held by eight gentlemen of the Privy Chamber.

Thirtv-two barons usually took part in the ceremony—if a king
and queen were crowned together there were two canopies with
four barons to each staff. The barons of Hastings had one cloth
with bells and staves, and after the ceremony gave it to the church
of Saint Richard at Chichester. I don't know of any church by
this name in Chichester, but close to the cathedral there is St.
mch."rd Walk, and in the cathedral there is St. Richard s tomb
™<1 St Richard's porch, so that there was probably a chapel of St.
RTchardbefore The pulpit cloth of St. Clement's
Church Hastings, used to be the coronation canopy ot ueorge I

The barons of Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich held the
oilrcloth" and gave it to the shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury,
dividing the staves and bells amongst themselves

T eu the Cinque Ports barons had the right of dining at the

11 ln„ banouet at the uppermost table on the king's right hana.
C°T°hey Tere fXom allsubsidies-that is, loans and taxes for the
<4nnr>ort of the national army. „',,.., T,
Tut thev made an ample return for all this, inasmuch, as I have
told vou before, during many centuries their navy was the roya

vv of England. Thus, in the time of Edward the First they had
"o furnish fifty-seven ships every time the king crossed the channel.
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 92 -->
Each ship had twenty armed soldiers who had to serve fifteen days,
and the total contribution was fifty-seven ships, eleven hundred and
eighty-seven men, and fifty-seven "garcions" or boys. Dover made
the largest contribution and Winchelsea the next, whilst we read
that such places as Bulverhithe, Pevensey, Bekesbourne and
Fordwich had to contribute.


The ancient court of the Cinque Ports, called the " Guestling,"
was first held at Shepway, or Shipway, Cross—an open space where
four roads meet on the top of the hills between Westenhanger and
L3*mpne—by order of Henry III. Here the Lord Warden—
descendant of the ancient Count of the Saxon Shore—was sworn
in, and here Mere heard cases of treason, falsifying money, services
withdrawn—that is, shirked—false judgment and the finding of
treasure. After the Revolution of 1688 the Court of Shepway was
held on Bredenstone Hill at the south-west side of Dover.


In Domesday Book Sandwich, Dover and Romney are spoken of
{empty}a.s privileged ports, but I don't think anybody knows how long ago
they were first privileged. In Saxon times the free men of the
Cinque Ports ranked as nobles, aud before our English Parliament
was divided into two Houses of Lords aud Commons the names of
the peeis of the realm and of the Cinque Ports barons were called
on a separate day from those of the burgesses, citizens, and knights.

Their summons to Parliament was not the ordinary summons.
The oath of fidelity to the crown was that they would maintain
and defend to the utmost power "the liberties, franchises,
privileges, and customs of the Cinque Ports and their members."  
  
  
  C—TRAVELLING IN KENT.


I fear that our county had a bad name amongst travellers both
by land and sea in the old days.

In the reign of Henry VIII. the roads of the Weald were so bad
that in 1523 was passed the first known Act of Parliament for the
repair and regulation of roads.

In Shakespeare's play of the second p.art of " King Henry the
Sixth " Lord Say, of Knole Park, Sevenoaks, who has been taken
prisoner byJack Cade and his rebels, is asked by Dick the Butcher
what he had to say about Kent. To which he replied in Latin,
\"Bona terra, mala gens," meaning, a fine country inhabited by
bad people, although he then says :—  
  
  
  " Kent, in the commentaries Cæsar writ,
Is termed the civil'st place of all this isle :
Sweet is the country, because full of riches,
The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy."  
  
  
  But this little bit of flattery didn't save Lord Say's head.
Then a poet named Taylor writes :—  
  
  
  " So are most thieves in Christendome and Kent."


Yes. There were land sharks and sea sharks in plenty. The
great roads were infested with highwaymen—especially the Dover
road on Blackheath and near Rochester and where it runs over
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 93 -->
Barham Downs, and the fashionable Tunbridge Wells road between
Farnborough and Sevenoaks. Blackheath and Shooters Hill were
always dotted with gibbets bearing the bodies of the cowardly
rascals whom so many foolish people speak of as romantic heroes,
and the old Brockley Jack, so named it is said from Jack Cade,
near Forest Hill, was a famous resort of the Blackheath robbers.

But this was not the only kind of robber to whom the Kentish
traveller was exposed until not so very many years ago.

Just listen to what the great novelist Smollett wrote in the year
1763 about the Dover road and Dover :

\"I need not tell you that this is the worst road in England with
respect to the conveniences of travelling, and must certainly impress
foreigners with an unfavourable opinion of the nation in general.
The chambers are in general cold and comfortless, the beds paltry,
the cookery execrable, the wine poison, the attendance bad, the
publicans insolent, and the bills extortion; there is not a drop of
tolerable malt liquor to be had from London to Dover.

\"Every landlord and every waiter harangued upon the knavery
of a publican in Canterbury who had charged the French ambassador
forty pounds for a supper which was not worth forty shillings
but when they produced their own bills they appeared to be all of
the same famity and complexion.

\"Dover is commonly termed a den of thieves, and I am afraid it
is not altogether without reason that it has acquired this
appellation. The people are said to live by piracy in time of war,
and by smuggling and fleecing strangers in time of peace. Without
all doubt a man cannot be worse lodged and worse treated in any
part of Europe; nor will he in any other place meet with more
flagrant instances of fraud, imposition, and brutality. One would
imagine they had formed a general conspiracy against all those who
either go to or return from the continent."

Then Smollett describes how he was robbed and insulted by the
boatmen, and even by the master of the vessel which was to take
him to France.


You who are familiar with the smart, comfortable steamers which
carry you over to France in a little more than an hour will be
interested in a description of the sort of vessel you would have had
to go by a hundred and thirty years ago.

\"We found ourselves in a most wretched hovel, on board what is
called a Folkestone cutter. The cabin was so small that a dog
could hardly turn in it, and the beds put me in mind of the holes
described in some catacombs in which the bodies of the dead were
deposited, being thrust in with the feet foremost. There was no
getting into them but endways, and indeed they seemed so dirty
that nothing but extreme necessity could have obliged me to use
them. We sat up all night in a most uncomfortable position,
tossed about by the sea, cramped, weary and languishing for want
of sleep."

This lasted from six one evening till three the next morning, and
then, instead of stepping ashore at once, the passengers had to row
three miles in a small open boat. The fare was five gnineas,
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 94 -->
besides "tips "to everybody who performed the smallest service,
from the captain downwards.

There is one poor consolation—the travellers were even worse
treated and more robbed on the French side than in Kent.


The experiences of Fielding, the novelist, ten years previously,
when the ship in which he sailed from London to Lisbon lay off
Deal, are of the same character. The prices asked by the Deal
people who came off to the ship for boat hire and for provisions were
so exorbitant that Fielding asked the captain of a man of war to put
him ashore, which was refused.

Wrecking—that is, the plundering of shipwrecked vessels—was
largely carried on by Deal people. Daniel Defoe, the author of
\"Robinson Crusoe," wrote very strongly about it in his account of
the storm of 1703.Speaking of some poor wretches cast upon the
GoodwinSands, he says :—

\"Some boats are said to have come very near them in quest of
booty and in search of plunder, and to carry oft'what they could get,
but nobody troubled themselves for the lives of these miserable
creatures."


And in a poem on the same subject he writes fiercely and
pathetically about the brutality of these sea sharks.

Lord Byron in " Don Juan " says about Dover :  
  
  
  ' Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties
To those who upon land and water dwell;
And, last not least, to strangers uninstructed,
Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted."


Even after the establishment of mail coaches the by-roads of
Kent and Sussex were famous for their-badness, and are not now at
the present day proper objects for pride in wet weather. Hasted,
our Kentish historian, wrote at the end of the last century :

\"The roads of these parts are hardly passable after any rain,
being so miry that the traveller's horse frequently plunges through
them up to the girths of the saddle, and the waggons sink so
deep in the ruts as to slide along on the nave of the wheels and
the axle of them."


At the beginning of the present century it was reported that the
cross roads of the Weald of Kent were the worst in the country.  
  
  
  D.—FAMOUS KENT MEN.


Kent has contributed her fair share to the famous men of our
country, and if no giant stands out like a Warwickshire Shakespeare,
or a Shropshire Clive, or a Lincolnshire Newton, Kent men have
been found well to the fore wherever the race has been to the swift
and the battle to the strong.


This is particularly remarkable in literature. I have shown how
Chaucer, if not Kentish by birth, has fair claims to be considered
Kentish by adoption John Gower, the greatest English scholar
of his day, although only one of the three poems by which he is
best known is in English, was an esquire of Kent. Caxton, the
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 95 -->
father of English printing, " was of Kent, in the Weald, where
is spoken as broad and rude English as any in England."

Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, the author of " Ferrex and
Porrex," our first regular drama, and of the " Mirror for
Magistrates" was a Sevenoaks man. Kit Marlowe; Lyly the
"Euphuist;" Sir Henry Wotton, poet, statesman and man of
letters; Sir Thomas Wyatt, of Allington, the admirer of Anne
Boleyn; Lovelace, the cavalier singer; and Sir Philip Sidney
were Kent men.


Fletcher, the dramatist, who wrote in partnership with Beaumont,
was a Cranbrook man; and Baker, whose chronicle is so valuable
to historical students, belonged to Sissinghurst. Christopher Smart,
the poet, was a Kent man.

The courtly Lord Chesterfield, author of the famous " Letters to
his son; " and the Rev. Johu Barham, better known as Ingoldsby,
were Kent men.


Charles Dickens was Kentish to the core, for many of his famous
pages tell of Kent—and, curiously enough, his first and his last
works, "Pickwick" and "Edwin Drood." In " David
Copperfield" he deals largely with our county; in "Great
Expectations" entirely. So j*ou may see the house where he
lived and died at Gads Hill, and the house he lived
in at Broadstairs, and Satis House at Rochester, and Cooling
churchyard, whence Pip in " Great Expectations " used to look over
the dreary marshes; and I daresay you can pick out Agnes
Wickfield's house at Canterbury. Rochester has many spots
associated with him, and I have myself no doubt that the road
along which Mr. Pickwick undertook to drive, and Mr. Winkle to
ride, was that which runs between Rochester and Maidstone; that
the cricket match between All Muggleton and Dingley Dell was
played in the same neighbourhood; whilst we know very well that
Mr. Tupman's " Leather Bottel" is still in Cobham village.

Two very famous soldiers at leant were Kent men—Sir Philip
Sidney, of Penshurst; and General Wolfe, of VVesterham. Sir
Sidney Smith, the gallant defender of St. John d'Acre in 1799
against Bonaparte was, I believe, Kent born—at any rate, he was
educated at Tonbridge school.

The unfortunate Admiral Byng was a Kent man, and so was Sir
George Rooke, who captured Gibraltar in 1704.

In "science Linacre, the botanist and first president of the Royal
College of Physicians; and Harvey, discoverer of the circulation of
the blood, were Kent men.

Amongst politicians we can claim Sir George Poynings, Lord
Deputy Tn Ireland, under Henry VIL, the author of " Poyning's
Law " or the " Statute of Drogheda," which made the Irish
Parliament absolutely dependent on that of England; and the
ill-fated, heroic Algernon Sidney. The great Earl of Chatham lived
at Hayes, and here was born his even more famous son,
William Pitt.
